Understanding within-host host-parasite interactions (dynamically)

Lots of molecular biology, genetics (*recognition* mechanisms and *effector* mechanisms), won't deal with that now.

Interaction between different components of the immune system (modeled at different levels of detail/realism), parasite populations (maybe in multiple compartments?)

Longitudinal data (rare), distributional data.

300-fold decline in viral RNA in some patients, but not clearance

"virus load paradox": if $R_0$ is initially 50, we would have to reduce it to slightly above 1 but never **below** 1 to see these results.

$$
\begin{split}
\frac{dC}{dt} & = \lambda - \mu C - \beta CV \\
\frac{dV}{dt} & = \beta CV - a V
\end{split}
$$

- add a drug-resistant type
- add mutation
- add immune responses ($dz/dt = kV - \gamma z$)
- homeostasis of infectible cells (logistic growth)
- virus-induced killing of uninfected cells (e.g. gp120 shedding)
- differential effects of drug on different types
- distribution of infectibility
