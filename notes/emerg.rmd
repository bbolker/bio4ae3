## emerging and re-emerging disease

![](pix/zoon_emerg.png)

basically, anything we're worried about

- new mutations
- change in environment
- resistant strains
- species jumps (encounter and compatibility: changes via recombination, mutation)

Do we need to understand *everything*?

- reservoir ecology
- pathogen biology
- human-reservoir interactions

How do we understand? How do we predict?

## *Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis*

**Reminders**

- fungal pathogen 
   - most other chytrids are saprophytes, plant pathogens
   - *B. salamandrivorans*: salamander pathogen (more restricted)
- first discoved in poison dart frogs
- caused die-offs in E Australia, Central America, Colorado, California ...
- association with high altitude?
- occurred in pristine areas (probably not anthropogenic?)
- pathogenesis via screwed-up osmoregulation

Very confusing ...

* some species decline in the absence of Bd
* some species stable in the presence of Bd  
(Bd may have been there all along?)
* susceptibility:
   * ability to bask
   * antimicrobial peptides

**tipping point hypothesis**: in populations all the time, but something happened to increase virulence/reduce tolerance or resistance

- climate change/El Niño ? 
- ultraviolet radiation?
- cooler temperatures? (basking etc.)
- pesticides?
- combination (species × temperature × U/V × pesticide × ...)

- @pounds_widespread_2006: "chytrid-thermal-optimum hypothesis"
- @rohr_evaluating_2008: "numerous other variables, including regional banana and beer production, were better predictors of these extinctions"
- @rohr_linking_2010

**novel pathogen hypothesis**: mutation/speciation + dispersal

- "Out of Africa" hypothesis
- earlier/broader detection in historical specimens: CA/bullfrog, Brazil ...
- genomics (challenging!)
- Asian sampling

## monkeypox

## climate change

- warming 
    - 'good' or 'bad' for pathogens?
    - vector biology
    	- extended range
		- higher activity?
- changes in seasonality, hydrological cycles
- local landscape change
    - hydrology
	- land cover (Lyme disease)
	- forest cover
- changes in reservoir communities

## dilution effect [@keesing_dilution_2021]
   - does increased biodiversity decrease disease?
   - variation in reservoir competence
   - high-quality hosts decrease with increasing biodiversity
       - encounter reduction; host regulation; vector preferences
