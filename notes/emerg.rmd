## emerging and re-emerging disease

![](pix/zoon_emerg.png)

basically, anything we're worried about

- encounter filter: changing patterns of reservoir host/vector distribution, human contact, ...
- compatibility filter: changes via mutation, recombination, selection for resistance, ...

Do we need to understand *everything*?

- reservoir ecology
- pathogen biology
- human-reservoir interactions

How do we understand? How do we predict?

## *Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis*

- fungal pathogen 
   - most other chytrids are saprophytes, plant pathogens
   - *B. salamandrivorans*: salamander pathogen (more restricted)
- first discoved in poison dart frogs
- caused die-offs in E Australia, Central America, Colorado, California ...
- association with high altitude?

Very confusing ...

- declines occurred in pristine areas (probably not anthropogenic?)
- some species decline in the absence of Bd
- some species stable in the presence of Bd

- **tipping point hypothesis**: in populations all the time, but something happened to increase virulence/reduce tolerance or resistance ($\approx$ compatibility filter)
   - climate change/El Niño ? 
   - ultraviolet radiation?
   - pesticides?
   - combination (species × temperature × U/V × pesticide × ...)?
[@pounds_widespread_2006; @rohr_evaluating_2008; @rohr_linking_2010]
- **novel pathogen hypothesis**: mutation/speciation + dispersal
   - detection in historical specimens: CA/bullfrog, Brazil ...
   - genomics (challenging!)
   - Asian sampling

## effects of climate change

- warming 
    - 'good' or 'bad' for pathogens?
    - vector biology
    	- extended range
		- higher activity?
		- e.g. @mordecaiClimate2020: shift from *Anopheles gambiae* to *Aedes aegypti*, malaria to arboviruses (dengue, chikungunya etc.)
- changes in seasonality, hydrological cycles
- local landscape change
    - hydrology
	- suburbanization and reforestation: Lyme disease
	- deforestation
	    - @macdonaldAmazon2019a: deforestation increases malaria, but malaria decreases deforestation
- changes in reservoir communities

## effects of biodiversity change: dilution effect [@keesing_dilution_2021]

- does increased biodiversity decrease disease?
- variation in reservoir competence
- high-quality hosts decrease with increasing biodiversity
    - encounter reduction; host regulation; vector preferences

## surveillance and prediction

* which viruses will emerge, where, why?

@evansExposure2023: 2017-2020 sample: 12% of 693 individuals sampled in Myanmar were seropositive for sarbecovirus, more likely if they were loggers/hunters or had been exposed to bats ...
