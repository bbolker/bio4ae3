- general info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batrachochytrium_dendrobatidis) and [here](https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Batrachochytrium_dendrobatidis)
- most chytrid fungi are harmless **saprophytes** or parasites of microbes, but a few are pathogenic on amphibians
- *Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis* ([Joyce Longcore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_E._Longcore))
- life cycle: *thallus* → *zoosporangia* (frog skin) → *zoospores* (free living, motile, aquatic) → ...
- alternative hosts/environmental reservoir?
- where did it come from?
    - **novel pathogen hypothesis**: mutation/speciation + dispersal
	- **tipping point hypothesis**: in populations all the time, but something happened to make it virulent
- extinction paradox [@de_castro_mechanisms_2005]
    - **extirpation** (local extinction) vs global ('true') extinction
    - **density-dependent** parasites can't cause host extinction (in simple theoretical models!)
	- alternatives: density-independence, small populations, reservoirs
