1. Discuss the range of methods available for
estimating R_0 from different types of data on
epidemics; explain which approaches would be
most important for different types of diseases
(human vs wildlife, epidemic vs endemic, etc.)

2. Define "parasites" and related types of
natural enemies. Discuss the significance 
of different parts of the definition and
their implications for the ecology and evolution
of host-parasite interactions.

3. Describe box models for disease. What do boxes,
solid lines, and dashed lines usually represent?

Construct a box model for a sexually transmitted disease
(heterosexually transmitted) with vaccination; 

4. Define the difference between microparasites
and macroparasites, both in terms of how they
have classically been defined and in terms
of their population dynamics and transmission.
Give some examples.  What are the differences
between them in terms of ecology and evolution,
and how they are modeled?

5. Define R_0 and explain why it is important.
What various kinds of information does knowing
R_0 give you about the likely outcomes of an
epidemic?  What does it tell you about disease
control?

6. What is the difference between frequency-
and density-dependent transmission?
Why is it important?  What kinds of diseases might
fall into either category? What are the implications for disease persistence
and control?
