The midterm will include **three** of these questions; you should plan to spend about 8-10 minutes on each answer.

1. Describe and explain as many methods as you can remember for
estimating R_0 from different types of data on
epidemics; explain which approaches would be
most important for different types of diseases
(human vs wildlife, epidemic vs endemic, etc.)

2. Define "parasites" and related types of
natural enemies. Discuss the significance 
of different parts of the definition and
their implications for the ecology and evolution
of host-parasite interactions.

3. Give one example of a model that can be 
used to study **within-host** dynamics of a disease.
Illustrate the structure with a box model where the
compartments either contain individual hosts or
within-host components. Describe the basic assumptions
of the model and write some equations describing the
*per capita* transition rates between the compartments.

4. Define the difference between microparasites
and macroparasites, both in terms of how they
have classically been used, in terms
of their population dynamics and transmission,
and how these two definitions are related.
Give some examples.  What are the differences
between them in terms of ecology and evolution,
and how they are modeled?

5. Define ${\cal R}_0$ and explain why it is important.
What information does knowing
${\cal R}_0$ give you about the outcomes of introducing
a parasite to a population?  What does it tell you about disease
control?

6. Describe how we can use phylogenetic comparative methods to establish 
the evolutionary history of an organismal trait (such as a parasitic lifestyle).
What data do we need? Make up an example showing how we would infer that 
a gut parasite evolved from a free-living ancestor by way of a commensal stage.

7. Discuss the population dynamics of red grouse populations in
Scotland and northern England, why you might suspect that parasites
were involved, an alternative hypothesis for
the observed dynamics, and describe the field experiments that provide
evidence that the population dynamics really are parasite-driven.

8. Discuss how parasites can create indirect links between
otherwise unconnected species in an ecological community; give
examples if you can.  Suppose you thought that parasites were
driving apparent competition between two fish species occupying 
temperate lakes; describe how you could use observations, experiments, 
and/or models to establish that parasites were really responsible.

9. Describe the use of parasites for biocontrol, giving some examples.
What are the advantages and disadvantages of using parasites
for biocontrol compared to classical methods (e.g. chemical treatments)?
