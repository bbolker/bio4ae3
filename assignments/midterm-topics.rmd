The midterm will include **three** of these questions; you should plan to spend about 8-10 minutes on each answer.

1. Explain the concept of **levels of selection** in evolution. Use at least two examples from host-parasite systems to illustrate how it works.

2. Define "parasites" and related types of
natural enemies. Discuss the significance 
of different parts of the definition and
their implications for the ecology and evolution
of host-parasite interactions.

3. Define the difference between microparasites
and macroparasites, both in terms of how they
have classically been used, in terms
of their population dynamics and transmission,
and how these two definitions are related.
Give some examples.  What are the differences
between them in terms of ecology and evolution,
and how they are modeled?

4. Describe how we can use phylogenetic comparative methods to establish 
the evolutionary history of an organismal trait (such as a parasitic lifestyle).
What data do we need? Make up an example showing how we would infer that 
a gut parasite evolved from a free-living ancestor by way of a commensal stage.

5. Describe the use of parasites for biocontrol, giving some examples.
What are the advantages and disadvantages of using parasites
for biocontrol compared to classical methods (e.g. chemical treatments)?

6. Discuss the roles of theoretical (model-based), lab experiments, field experiments, and observational data in understanding ecological and evolutionary systems. What are the costs/benefits or advantages/disadvantages of each kind of information? Give at least one example of each level of information and how it applies to our knowledge of a particular host-parasite system; for at least one system, contrast the contribution of two different levels.

7. Compare and contrast population cycles in parasite *prevalence* in a constant or slowly changing host population with population cycles in the *size* (density or number) of a host population. Explain how each works, using diagrams or equations if it helps you explain clearly. Give at least one example (include some information about the example beyond just the names of the parasite and the host).

8. Describe box models for disease. Construct a box model for a sexually transmitted disease (heterosexually transmitted) with vaccination where male-female and female-male transmission rates may differ.
