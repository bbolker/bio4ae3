The midterm will include **three** of these questions; you should plan to spend about 8-10 minutes on each answer.

1. Describe and explain as many methods as you can remember for
estimating R_0 from different types of data on
epidemics; explain which approaches would be
most important for different types of diseases
(human vs wildlife, epidemic vs endemic, etc.)

2. Define "parasites" and related types of
natural enemies. Discuss the significance 
of different parts of the definition and
their implications for the ecology and evolution
of host-parasite interactions.

3. Describe box models for disease. What do boxes,
solid lines, and dashed lines usually represent?
Construct a box model for an epidemic of gonorrhea in
a heterosexual population where you keep track of
males and females separately (gonorrhea can be treated with
antibiotics, but recovered people do not develop immunity).
Write down a set of equations that corresponds to these boxes.

4. Define the difference between microparasites
and macroparasites, both in terms of how they
have classically been used, in terms
of their population dynamics and transmission,
and how these two definitions are related.
Give some examples.  What are the differences
between them in terms of ecology and evolution,
and how they are modeled?

5. Define ${\cal R}_0$ and explain why it is important.
What information does knowing
${\cal R}_0$ give you about the outcomes of introducing
a parasite to a population?  What does it tell you about disease
control?

6. What is the difference between frequency-
and density-dependent transmission?
Why is it important?  What kinds of parasites might
typically follow one mode or the other? (Why?) 
What are the implications of frequency- vs density-dependent transmission
for disease persistence and control?

7. Discuss the population dynamics of red grouse populations in
Scotland and northern England, why they might be affected by
interactions with parasites, and the field experiments that provide
evidence that the population dynamics really are parasite-driven.

8. Discuss how parasites can create indirect links between
otherwise unconnected species in an ecological community; give
examples if you can.  Suppose you thought that parasites were
driving apparent competition between two fish species occupying 
temperate lakes; describe how you could use observations, experiments, 
and/or models to establish that parasites were really responsible.

9. Describe the use of parasites for biocontrol, giving some examples.
What are the advantages and disadvantages of using parasites
for biocontrol compared to classical methods (e.g. chemical treatments)?

10. What is a matching-alleles model for host-parasite interactions?
What kind of molecular mode of infection and resistance might give rise
to this pattern of interaction? What are the expected evolutionary dynamics
over time, and the resulting temporal changes in host resistance and
parasite infectivity?
