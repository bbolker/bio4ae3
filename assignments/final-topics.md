## essay questions, final test

*One* of these questions will be on the final test.

1. How are "Red Queen" coevolutionary dynamics different from "trench warfare" coevolution?
Define each term and explain the kinds of genes/traits that we would expect to be involved
in each type of coevolution. Describe one experiment we might do or set of observations we might
make that would determine which type of coevolution was occurring in a particular host-parasite system.

2. Define host resistance and tolerance to parasites; draw a diagram, properly labeled, to illustrate the difference between them. Explain why resistance alleles tend to be polymorphic while tolerance alleles tend to be fixed within a population (i.e., either absent or [close to] 100%).

3. Name three characteristics of parasites that affect the probability that a new resistance mutation will appear (*de novo* mutation), and three characteristics that affect the probability that one will spread in the population once it occurs (evolution based on *standing variation*). Using these characteristics, explain why *de novo* mutation is characteristic of viral resistance evolution and evolution based on standing variation is characteristic of bacterial resistance evolution.
