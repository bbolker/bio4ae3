  abstract = {SUMMARY
	
	This review updates on numerous topics relating to the evolutionary
	
	origins of varicella zoster virus (VZV), the replication cycle, virion
	
	assembly, and the recent genomic analyses. VZV is one of eight
	
	human herpesviruses that have existed for at least 400 million years.
	
	It has co-evolved with humankind and is present in all nationalities
	
	globally. The pathogenesis of varicella (chickenpox) is dependent
	on
	
	viral replication and dispersion through the body in T-lymphocytes.
	
	VZV replication is similar to that of herpes simplex virus.
	
	A complete analysis of VZV transcripts has identified their relative
	
	abundance, with the transcripts for the regulatory proteins (open
	
	reading frame) ORF62 and ORF63 among the greatest. Studies of
	
	virion assembly have shown that endocytosis pathways are involved
	
	in the envelopment process by the viral glycoproteins. The complete
	
	sequencing of five VZV strains has identified numerous single
	
	nucleotide polymorphisms, and in turn, VZV strains have been
	
	segregated into European/North American and Asian clades.
	
	Furthermore, a small number of mutant VZV strains have been
	
	identified. These results suggest more diversity between VZV strains
	
	than previously recognized.},

  volume = {21},
  pages = {585-592},

  abstract = {Mutualisms are ubiquitous in nature despite the widely held view that
	they are unstable interactions. Models predict that mutualists might
	often evolve into parasites, can abandon their partners to live autonomously
	and are also vulnerable to extinction. Yet a basic empirical question,
	whether mutualisms commonly break down, has been mostly overlooked.
	As we discuss here, recent progress in molecular systematics helps
	address this question. Newly constructed phylogenies reveal that
	parasites as well as autonomous (non-mutualist) taxa are nested within
	ancestrally mutualistic clades. Although models have focused on the
	propensity of mutualism to become parasitic, such shifts appear relatively
	rarely. By contrast, diverse systems exhibit reversions to autonomy,
	and this might be a common and unexplored endpoint to mutualism.},

	Here an age-structured epidemiologic–demographic model with vaccination
	is developed for varicella and zoster. Parameters are estimated from
	epidemiological data. This mathematical and computer simulation model
	is used to evaluate the effects of varicella vaccination programs.
	Although the age distribution of varicella cases does shift in the
	simulations, this does not seem to be a danger because many of the
	adult cases occur after vaccine-induced immunity wanes, so they are
	mild varicella cases with fewer complications. In the simulations,
	zoster incidence increases in the ﬁrst three decades after initiation
	of a vaccination program, because people who had varicella in childhood
	age without boosting, but then it decreases. Thus the simulations
	validate the second danger of more zoster cases.},
