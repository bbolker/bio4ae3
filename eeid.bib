	This review updates on numerous topics relating to the evolutionary
	
	origins of varicella zoster virus (VZV), the replication cycle, virion
	
	assembly, and the recent genomic analyses. VZV is one of eight
	
	human herpesviruses that have existed for at least 400 million years.
	
	It has co-evolved with humankind and is present in all nationalities
	
	globally. The pathogenesis of varicella (chickenpox) is dependent
	on
	
	viral replication and dispersion through the body in T-lymphocytes.
	
	VZV replication is similar to that of herpes simplex virus.
	
	A complete analysis of VZV transcripts has identified their relative
	
	abundance, with the transcripts for the regulatory proteins (open
	
	reading frame) ORF62 and ORF63 among the greatest. Studies of
	
	virion assembly have shown that endocytosis pathways are involved
	
	in the envelopment process by the viral glycoproteins. The complete
	
	sequencing of five VZV strains has identified numerous single
	
	nucleotide polymorphisms, and in turn, VZV strains have been
	
	segregated into European/North American and Asian clades.
	
	Furthermore, a small number of mutant VZV strains have been
	
	identified. These results suggest more diversity between VZV strains
	
	than previously recognized.},

	abstract = {Why some individuals develop AIDS rapidly whereas others remain healthy without treatment for many years remains a central question of HIV research. An evolutionary perspective reveals an apparent conflict between two levels of selection on the virus. On the one hand, there is rapid evolution of the virus in the host, and on the other, new observations indicate the existence of virus factors that affect the virulence of infection whose influence persists over years in infected individuals and across transmission events. Here, we review recent evidence that shows that viral genetic factors play a larger role in modulating disease severity than anticipated. We propose conceptual models that reconcile adaptive evolution at both levels of selection. Evolutionary analysis provides new insight into HIV pathogenesis.
Background Why some individuals develop AIDS rapidly whereas others remain healthy without treatment for many years remains a central question of HIV research. Of the quantities that predict how quickly an untreated infection progresses, the most widely used is set-point viral load. This measure varies by orders of magnitude between infected individuals and is predictive of infectiousness and time to onset of AIDS. Host factors, predominantly linked to the immune system, are known to influence the set point, but much variation remains unexplained.
A transmission chain with heritable virulence. Individuals infected with HIV show differences in clinical progression. Untreated infections are characterized by viral loads (the viral particle density in the blood) that are relatively stable for years, but they can differ by orders of magnitude between individuals. Host factors clearly influence viral load, but viral loads have also recently been found to correlate among individuals in transmission pairs and chains. This indicates a moderate to strong influence of viral genotype on the viral load. Strikingly, this influence persists for years and across transmission events, despite intense within-host viral evolution. A transmission chain with heritable virulence. Individuals infected with HIV show differences in clinical progression. Untreated infections are characterized by viral loads (the viral particle density in the blood) that are relatively stable for years, but they can differ by orders of magnitude between individuals. Host factors clearly influence viral load, but viral loads have also recently been found to correlate among individuals in transmission pairs and chains. This indicates a moderate to strong influence of viral genotype on the viral load. Strikingly, this influence persists for years and across transmission events, despite intense within-host viral evolution.
Advances We review recent evidence showing that HIV genotype influences the set-point viral load far more than anticipated. Our summary of published estimates suggests that 33\% (95\% confidence interval, 20 to 46\%) of the variation is attributable to the virus. Because set-point viral load is heritable (partially controlled by virus genotype) and is linked to transmissibility, it is likely to have evolved to maintain transmission fitness and may continue to evolve in response to diverse selection pressures. These findings are unexpected and paradoxical because rapid and error-prone viral replication should favor within-host adaptation and rapidly scramble signals of viral genotype as infection progresses, rather than leaving a lasting footprint that is preserved throughout an infection and from one infection to the next in transmission chains.
Outlook We propose that resolving the paradox of heritability of set-point viral load will provide new insights into the mechanisms of HIV pathogenesis. To this end, we provide three parsimonious, testable, and nonexclusive explanatory mechanisms. The first states that HIV evolution in virulence genes is more functionally constrained than previously thought. The second proposes that virulence of HIV is mediated through the virus‚Äôs capacity to systemically activate target cells in which it can efficiently replicate. The capacity to activate would not be expected to evolve rapidly because it does not provide a specific selective advantage to virus strains that activate more cells; rather, it is an advantage shared by all viruses. The third mechanism implicates the preferential transmission of viruses that are stored in nonreplicating cells or during early infection, and the disproportionate influence on long-term pathogenesis of these early viruses. In addition to these insights into mechanisms of pathogenesis, we believe that this research highlights a major gap in our knowledge of HIV. The identification of the genetic determinants of HIV virulence, which appear to vary between closely related strains of the virus, should be a major priority. Thus, whole-genome association studies that are focused on the virus genome should be pursued and expanded, as well as more functional and mechanistic studies, which could be guided by hypotheses such as those presented here.
HIV Virulence
A major focus of research on HIV is on host responses to infection‚Äîunderstandably, because the virus targets the immune system and because of the interest in vaccine development. In reviewing what little research has been done on viral virulence determinants, Fraser et al. (10.1126/science.1243727) present evolutionary explanations for some of the poorly understood phenomena that mark HIV infection, including long-term survivorship, latency, rapid within-host evolution, and inheritability of between-host virulence.},

Some untreated patients infected by HIV die within a couple of years, while others survive more than 25 years. To date, it is still unclear whether this variance in the virulence of the infection is due to the host or to the virus genotype. One of the main difficulties in answering this question is that, as for most human diseases, we tend not to know who infected whom. Here, we solve this problem by adopting a phylogenetic approach, which estimates the heritability of species traits on a phylogeny. In our case, species correspond to infected patients and the trait is an infection trait. The phylogeny is obtained from the HIV RNA sequences isolated in each patient. We find that more than half of the variance observed in the set-point viral load‚Äîa trait that predicts virulence‚Äîis heritable from one infection to the next. This implies that set-point viral load is strongly controlled by the virus genotype. This application of the phylogenetic comparative approach to infectious diseases yields major results for the deciphering of HIV pathogenesis. Future applications to other traits and/or other pathogens will help us to better understand rapidly evolving diseases of humans.},

Although several of these pathogens are transmitted by blood-feeding arthropods, HIV is not. A number of properties of HIV and its life cycle have been identified as proximate explanations for the absence of arthropod transmission, but little consideration has been given to why HIV has not evolved this form of transmission. We consider the empirical evidence for arthropod transmission, and suggest that mechanical transmission has not evolved in HIV because such strains would induce a faster onset of AIDS during infection, which would thereby limit their ability to spread. On the other hand, it is not as clear why biological transmission has not occurred. Available data suggests that a lack of appropriate genetic variation in HIV is one explanation, but it is also possible that a conflict between natural selection occurring within and between infected individuals has prevented its evolution instead. We discuss the potential significance of these ideas, and argue that taking such an evolutionary perspective broadens our understanding of infectious diseases and the potential consequences of public health interventions.},

Whether this evolution will lead to changes in the transmission, the duration, or the severity of the disease is not clear. This has led to considerable scientific and media debate, from raising alarms about evolutionary change to dismissing it. Here we review what little is currently known about the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and extend existing evolutionary theory to consider how selection might be acting upon the virus during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although there is currently no definitive evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is undergoing further adaptation, continued evidence-based analysis of evolutionary change is important so that public health measures can be adjusted in response to substantive changes in the infectivity or severity of COVID-19.},

Theory of mathematical epidemiology and social evolution predicts that prudent pathogens can evolve when they cluster in space and share the mutual benefits of prudent exploitation of the host population. Here we extend the theory to study the effect of spatial structure on the evolution of pathogens that can transmit both horizontally and vertically. We explore these effects experimentally by competing the latent bacteriophage Œª and the virulent mutant ŒªcI857 in spatially structured epidemics and gradually erode spatial structure. We show that the latent bacteriophage Œª only wins in a spatially structured epidemic. Yet, a breakdown of the epidemic structure by long-range transmission reduces the benefit of latency by 500 fold. This demonstrates that long-rage transmission, as for example by air travel, might select for much more virulent types of previously latent viruses.},

Four sets of new predictions emerge. First, compared to virulence coevolving with resistance or tolerance, three-trait coevolution promotes more virulence and less tolerance, and broadens conditions under which pure defenses evolve. Second, the cost and efficiency of virulence and the epidemiological rates are the key factors of virulence coevolving with resistance and tolerance. Maximum virulence evolves for intermediate infection rate, at which coevolved levels of resistance and tolerance are both high. The influence of host and parasite background mortalities is strong on the evolution of defenses and weak on the coevolution of virulence. Third, evolutionary correlations between defenses can switch sign along single-parameter gradients. The evolutionary trade-off between resistance and tolerance may coevolve with virulence that either increases or decreases monotonically, depending on the underlying parameter gradient. Fourth, despite global attractiveness and stability of coevolutionary equilibria, not-so-rare and not-so-small mutations can beget large variation in virulence and defenses around equilibrium, in the form of transient ‚Äúevolutionary spikes.‚Äù Implications for evolutionary management of infections are discussed and directions for future research are outlined.},

However, little is known about whether animals can evolve tolerance (the ability to limit the damage caused by a given parasite burden). Using rodent malaria in laboratory mice as a model system and the statistical framework developed by plant-pathogen biologists, we demonstrated genetic variation for tolerance, as measured by the extent to which anemia and weight loss increased with increasing parasite burden. Moreover, resistance and tolerance were negatively genetically correlated. These results mean that animals, like plants, can evolve two conceptually different types of defense, a finding that has important implications for the understanding of the epidemiology and evolution of infectious diseases.},

	abstract = {Questions: Does virulence of socially parasitic slave-making ants vary in interactions with diÔ¨Äerent host species? If so, can this be linked to host properties such as nest availability or resistance of host species? Study system: Our study system included three slave-making ant species, Polyergus breviceps, Formica puberula, and F. gynocrates, and two host species, F occulta and F. sp. cf. argentea. Methods: We measured slave-maker virulence by comparing the mortality rates of host nests that were raided by slave-makers to host nests that were not raided. To determine whether slave-makers that were more likely to over-exploit slave resources were more prudent (lower virulence), we compared the percentage of nests that were raided for each host species. To determine whether variation in slave-maker virulence was due to diÔ¨Äerent levels of host resistance, we compared the aggressiveness of the two host species towards slave-makers during slave raids, reasoning that nests of a more aggressive host species would show higher survivorship. Results: Slave-makers were highly virulent in association with the host, F sp. cf argentea, but more benign in interactions with F occulta. Formica occulta was not universally more aggressive against slave-makers than F sp. cf. argentea, suggesting that this alone is not a suÔ¨Äicient explanation for the higher survivorship of this species. Slave-makers that specialized on F occulta were at higher risk of over-exploiting resources, indicating that more prudent slave-maker strategies might be selected for in interactions with this host.},

Using a combination of models and experiments on an amphibian species suffering extirpations from the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), we show that while transmission from an environmental Bd reservoir increased the ability of Bd to invade an amphibian population and the extinction risk of that population, Bd-induced extinction dynamics were far more sensitive to host resistance and tolerance than to Bd transmission. We demonstrate that this is a general result for load-dependent pathogens, where non-linear resistance and tolerance functions can interact such that small changes in these functions lead to drastic changes in extinction dynamics.},

Although antibiotic resistance in environmental bacteria is ancient, resistance in human pathogens is thought to be a modern phenomenon that is driven by the clinical use of antibiotics1. Here we show that particular lineages of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus‚Äîa notorious human pathogen‚Äîappeared in European hedgehogs in the pre-antibiotic era. Subsequently, these lineages spread within the local hedgehog populations and between hedgehogs and secondary hosts, including livestock and humans. We also demonstrate that the hedgehog dermatophyte Trichophyton erinacei produces two Œ≤-lactam antibiotics that provide a natural selective environment in which methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates have an advantage over susceptible isolates. Together, these results suggest that methicillin resistance emerged in the pre-antibiotic era as a co-evolutionary adaptation of S. aureus to the colonization of dermatophyte-infected hedgehogs. The evolution of clinically relevant antibiotic-resistance genes in wild animals and the connectivity of natural, agricultural and human ecosystems demonstrate that the use of a One Health approach is critical for our understanding and management of antibiotic resistance, which is one of the biggest threats to global health, food security and development.},

Drugs and vaccines both impose substantial pressure on pathogen populations to evolve resistance and indeed, drug resistance typically emerges soon after the introduction of a drug. But vaccine resistance has only rarely emerged. Using well-established principles of population genetics and evolutionary ecology, we argue that two key differences between vaccines and drugs explain why vaccines have so far proved more robust against evolution than drugs. First, vaccines tend to work prophylactically while drugs tend to work therapeutically. Second, vaccines tend to induce immune responses against multiple targets on a pathogen while drugs tend to target very few. Consequently, pathogen populations generate less variation for vaccine resistance than they do for drug resistance, and selection has fewer opportunities to act on that variation. When vaccine resistance has evolved, these generalities have been violated. With careful forethought, it may be possible to identify vaccines at risk of failure even before they are introduced.},

One source of disagreement concerns the major mechanisms by which antibiotics select resistant strains. For infections like tuberculosis, in which resistance can emerge in treated hosts through mutation, prevention of antimicrobial resistance in individual hosts is a primary method of preventing the spread of resistant organisms in the community. By contrast, for many other important resistant pathogens, such as penicillin-resistant Streptococcus
pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium resistance is mediated by the acquisition of genes or gene fragments by horizontal transfer; resistance in the treated host is a relatively rare event. For these organisms, indirect, population-level mechanisms of selection account for the increase in the prevalence of resistance. These mechanisms can operate even when treatment has a modest, or even negative, effect on an individual host‚Äôs colonization with resistant organisms.},

	abstract = {The Œî32 mutation at the CCR5 locus is a well-studied example of natural selection acting in humans. The mutation is found principally in Europe and western Asia, with higher frequencies generally in the north. Homozygous carriers of the Œî32 mutation are resistant to HIV-1 infection because the mutation prevents functional expression of the CCR5 chemokine receptor normally used by HIV-1 to enter CD4+ T cells. HIV has emerged only recently, but population genetic data strongly suggest Œî32 has been under intense selection for much of its evolutionary history. To understand how selection and dispersal have interacted during the history of the Œî32 allele, we implemented a spatially explicit model of the spread of Œî32. The model includes the effects of sampling, which we show can give rise to local peaks in observed allele frequencies. In addition, we show that with modest gradients in selection intensity, the origin of the Œî32 allele may be relatively far from the current areas of highest allele frequency. The geographic distribution of the Œî32 allele is consistent with previous reports of a strong selective advantage ({\textgreater}10\%) for Œî32 carriers and of dispersal over relatively long distances ({\textgreater}100 km/generation). When selection is assumed to be uniform across Europe and western Asia, we find support for a northern European origin and long-range dispersal consistent with the Viking-mediated dispersal of Œî32 proposed by G. Lucotte and G. Mercier. However, when we allow for gradients in selection intensity, we estimate the origin to be outside of northern Europe and selection intensities to be strongest in the northwest. Our results describe the evolutionary history of the Œî32 allele and establish a general methodology for studying the geographic distribution of selected alleles.},

	abstract = {A mutant allele of the chemokine receptor CCR5 gene (CCR5-Œî32), which confers resistance to HIV-1 infection, is believed to have originated from a single mutation event in historic times, and rapidly expanded in Caucasian populations, owing to an unknown selective advantage. Among other candidates, the plague bacillus Yersinia pestis was implicated as a potential source of strong selective pressure on European populations during medieval times. Here, we report amplifications of the CCR5-Œî32 DNA sequence from up to 2900-year-old skeletal remains from different burial sites in central Germany and southern Italy. Furthermore, the allele frequency of CCR5-Œî32 in victims of the 14th century plague pandemic in L√ºbeck/northern Germany was not different from a historic control group. Our findings indicate that this mutation was prevalent already among prehistoric Europeans. The results also argue against the possibility of plague representing a major selective force that caused rapid increase in CCR5-Œî32 gene frequencies within these populations.},

A major group of protozoan parasites, the phylum Apicomplexa, that includes the aetiological agents of malaria, toxoplasmosis and coccidiosis, all have dimorphic sexual stages. The sex ratio (proportion of males produced by parasites) is predicted to depend upon the inbreeding rate, and it has been suggested that sex-ratio data oÔ¨Äer a relatively cheap and easy method for indirectly estimating inbreeding rates. Here, we exploit a new theoretical machinery to show that there are generally valid relationships between f, Wright's coeÔ¨Äicient of inbreeding, and sex ratio, z*, the generality being with respect to population structure. To focus the discussion, we concentrate on malaria and show that the previously derived result, f = 1 - 2z*, does not depend on the artiÔ¨Åcial assumptions about population structure that were previously made. Not only does this justify the use of sex ratio as an indirect measure oÔ¨Ä, but also we argue that it may actually be preferable to measure f by measuring sex ratios, rather than by measuring departures from Hardy-Weinberg genotypic proportions both in malaria and parasites more generally.},

However, direct empirical evidence of long-term host‚Äìparasite coevolution, in particular 'Red Queen' dynamics‚Äîin which antagonistic biotic interactions such as host‚Äìparasite interactions can lead to reciprocal evolutionary dynamics‚Äîis rare, and current data, although consistent with theories of antagonistic coevolution, do not reveal the temporal dynamics of the process. Dormant stages of both the water flea Daphnia and its microparasites are conserved in lake sediments, providing an archive of past gene pools. Here we use this fact to reconstruct rapid coevolutionary dynamics in a natural setting and show that the parasite rapidly adapts to its host over a period of only a few years. A coevolutionary model based on negative frequency-dependent selection, and designed to mimic essential aspects of our host‚Äìparasite system, corroborated these experimental results. In line with the idea of continuing host‚Äìparasite coevolution, temporal variation in parasite infectivity changed little over time. In contrast, from the moment the parasite was first found in the sediments, we observed a steady increase in virulence over time, associated with higher fitness of the parasite.},

In a preliminary analysis of single outbreaks of infection deterministic compartmental models are used to estimate feasible ranges for the transmission rate of the infection and the level of disease-induced mortality. These results also indicate that the level of transmission in 1988 was probably sufficient to eradicate the infection throughout the Northern European common seal populations by the end of the first outbreak. An analysis of longer-term infection dynamics, which takes account of the density-dependent recovery of seal population levels, corroborates this finding. It also indicates that a reintroduction of the virus would be unlikely to cause an outbreak on the scale of the 1988 epizootic until the seal population had recovered for at least 10 years.

To investigate what happens when a trophic cascade pushes a host population over a host-threshold density, I analyzed a 20-year data set of kelp forest communities at 16 sites in the region of the Channel Islands National Park, California, USA. Historically, lobsters, and perhaps other predators, kept urchin populations at low levels and kelp forests developed a community-level trophic cascade. In geographic areas where the main predators on urchins were fished, urchin populations increased to the extent that they overgrazed algae and starvation eventually limited urchin-population growth. Despite the limitation of urchin population size by food availability, urchin densities, at times, well exceeded the host-density threshold for epidemics. An urchin-specific bacterial disease entered the region after 1992 and acted as a density-dependent mortality source. Dense populations were more likely to experience epidemics and suffer higher mortality. Disease did not reduce the urchin population at a site to the density that predators previously did. Therefore, disease did not fully replace predators in the trophic cascade. These results indicate how fishing top predators can indirectly favor disease transmission in prey populations.},

	abstract = {It is widely acknowledged (1) that meningeal helminths (Parelaphostrongylus tenuis) carried by white‚Äîtailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) but fatal to moose (Alces alces) and other cervids, have caused widespread population declines where deer have invaded the ranges of other cervids, (2) that meningeal worms can alter the outcome of interspecific competition between cervid hosts, and (3) that moose populations persist on enzootic range in habitat refuges not frequented by deer. Further, some attempts to reintroduce other cervids to range now occupied by deer have failed. However, moose have been observed to persist on range sympatric with deer, there is evidence that at least one moose population introduced to range with deer is growing, and other events (such as habitat change) are confounded with the presumed effects of meningeal worms. Thus, it is still not clear whether the mortality of individual cervids attributed to meningeal worms necessarily has the effects on population dynamics ascribed to it. Using conventional host‚Äîmacroparasite models, we describe the population dynamics of deer, moose, intermediate gastropod hosts, and the parasite to determine conditions under which the meningeal worm might be implicated in widespread declines of moose populations. The analysis resulted in three general scenarios depending on (1) the magnitude of parameters that affect transmission rates between different phases of the parasite life cycle, (2) the parasite‚Äîinduced mortality rate of moose, and (3) the difference in comptitive ability between deer and moose. First, when larval transmission to intermediate hosts, consumption of intermediate hosts by definitive hosts, and parasite‚Äîinduced mortality of moose were all small, and the competitive difference between definitive hosts was large, moose excluded deer. Second, moose and deer could coexist at either a stable or unstable equilibrium. Stable coexistence occurred when transmission rates, mortality rates, and competitive differences were all large; then deer outnumbered moose. Unstable coexistence at equilibrium occurred under the opposite conditions; moose then were more abundant than deer. Finally, deer could competitively exclude moose. To determine which of these cases was most plausible, we substituted available estimates for some parameters from published literature, solved the equations numerically, and conducted a sensitivity analysis. Overall, model solutions were most sensitive to the magnitude of the competitive effect of moose on deer, the parasite‚Äîinduced mortality rate of moose, and the intrinsic rate of increase of the intermediate host‚Äìall parameters for which there is little empirical information. We conclude that, with the available empirical information, meningeal worm cannot be ruled out as a factor contributing to declines of moose populations. However, our analyses suggest that moose populations sympatric with deer, in many cases, should not become extinct. This implies that reintroductions of moose (and perhaps other cervids) to range now occupied by deer need not be presumed to fail necessarily. Moose may be able to coexist with deer, albeit at lower densities, even in the absence of habitat refuges from the disease.},

Furthermore, the worm burdens picked up appeared to be sufficient to negatively influence host condition. These results provide evidence that infection from pheasants determines the worm burdens of partridges in the field, supporting the hypothesis that parasite-mediated apparent competition with the pheasant may be a factor influencing the decline and subsequent recovery of wild grey partridges.},

By combining multiscale field data with manipulative experiments, we evaluated patterns of parasite coinfection in amphibian hosts and their underlying mechanisms. Surveys of 86 wetlands and 1273 hosts revealed positive correlations between two pathogenic trematodes (Ribeiroia ondatrae and Echinostoma trivolvis) both between wetlands and within individual hosts. In infection and coinfection experiments, Ribeiroia caused greater pathology than Echinostoma, including high host mortality (24\%) and severe limb malformations (75\%). No interactive effects were noted for host pathology, but both parasites decreased the per capita persistence of one another by 17‚Äì36\%. Thus, in spite of consistently positive associations from field data, these parasites negatively affected the persistence of one another, likely via cross immunity (apparent competition). These findings underscore the danger of inferring parasite interactions from coinfection patterns and emphasize the potential disconnect between within-host processes (e.g., competition) and between-host processes (e.g., exposure and transmission). Here, correlated coinfections likely resulted from similarities in the parasites' host requirements and heterogeneity in host susceptibility or exposure. Understanding complex interactions among parasites depends critically on the scale under consideration, highlighting the importance of combining coinfection field studies with mechanistic experiments.},

In nature, however, coinfecting parasites that antagonize or facilitate each other‚Äîfor example, by altering cross-protective host immune responses‚Äîcan modulate host infection outcomes and parasite transmission relative to a single infection. Under what conditions is coinfection likely to interfere with parasite-mediated apparent competition among hosts? To address this question, we created a model of two coinfected host species. Parasites could interact indirectly by affecting host reproduction or directly by modulating recovery and disease-induced mortality of each host species to a focal infection. We grounded our model with parameters from a classic apparent competition system but allowed for multiple parasite transmission modes and interaction scenarios. Our results suggest that infection-induced mortality has an outsized effect on competition outcomes relative to recovery but that coinfection-mediated modulation of mortality can produce a range of coexistence or competitive exclusion outcomes. Moreover, while infection prevalence is sensitive to variation in parasite transmission mode, host competitive outcomes are not. Our generalizable model highlights the influence of immunological variation and parasite ecology on community ecology.},

We review the primary theoretical mechanisms that allow disease-induced extinction and compare them with the empirical literature on parasitic threats to populations to assess the importance of different mechanisms in threatening natural populations.

An emerging infectious disease, chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is directly linked to the recent extinction or serious decline of hundreds of amphibian species. Despite continued spread of this pathogen into uninfected areas, the dynamics of the host‚Äìpathogen interaction remain unknown. We use fine-scale spatiotemporal data to describe (i) the invasion and spread of Bd through three lake basins, each containing multiple populations of the mountain yellow-legged frog, and (ii) the accompanying host‚Äìpathogen dynamics. Despite intensive sampling, Bd was not detected on frogs in study basins until just before epidemics began. Following Bd arrival in a basin, the disease spread to neighboring populations at ‚âà700 m/yr in a wave-like pattern until all populations were infected. Within a population, infection prevalence rapidly reached 100\% and infection intensity on individual frogs increased in parallel. Frog mass mortality began only when infection intensity reached a critical threshold and repeatedly led to extinction of populations. Our results indicate that the high growth rate and virulence of Bd allow the near-simultaneous infection and buildup of high infection intensities in all host individuals; subsequent host population crashes therefore occur before Bd is limited by density-dependent factors. Preventing infection intensities in host populations from reaching this threshold could provide an effective strategy to avoid the extinction of susceptible amphibian species in the wild.},

Here, we address this issue by providing an overview of how testing of a pluralist idea for the maintenance of sex could be achieved.

	abstract = {Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) play a critical role in immune recognition and are the most genetically diverse loci known. One hypothesis to explain this diversity postulates that pathogens adapt to common MHC haplotypes and thus favour selection of new or rare alleles. To determine whether the pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans adapts to MHC-dependent immune responses, it was serially passaged in two independent replicate lines of Ô¨Åve B10 MHC-congenic strains and Balb/c mice. All passaged lines increased in virulence as measured by reduced host survival. MHC inÔ¨Çuenced the rate (trajectory) of virulence increase during passages as measured by signiÔ¨Åcant diÔ¨Äerences in mortality rate (p {\textless} 0.001). However, when the post-passage strains were tested, no MHC diÔ¨Äerences in mortality rate remained and only minor diÔ¨Äerences in titres were observed. Also contrary to expectations, increased virulence in three lines passaged in B 10 mice had a larger eÔ¨Äect in Balb/c mice, and the evolution of virulence in lines passaged in alternating hosts was not retarded. To our knowledge, these data represent the Ô¨Årst experimental test of MHC-speciÔ¨Åc adaptation in a non-viral pathogen. The failure to observe MHC eÔ¨Äects despite dramatically increased virulence and host-genotype-speciÔ¨Åc adaptation to non-MHC genes suggests that escape of MHC-dependent immune recognition may be diÔ¨Äicult for pathogens with unlimited epitopes or that other virulence factors can swamp MHC eÔ¨Äects.},

Here, we present a theoretical model that may be able to explain some of these discrepancies. We show that if low gainetocyte densities lead to a danger that female gametes may not encounter any male gametes, then natural selection favors a less female-biased sex ratio as a form of 'fertility insurance' to ensure that female gametes are mated. This model can be applied to a number of situations. In particular, (1) empirical data suggest that the number of gametoeyes per blood meal can be low enough to favor fertility insurance in some Plasmodium infections in humans and (2) our model predicts facultative shifting toward less-biased sex ratios in response to immune pressure that reduces gametocyte or gamete survival or mobility, consistent with Some recent experimental data from Plasmodium species of birds and mice.},

	abstract = {Establishing the selÔ¨Ång rate of parasites is important for studies in clinical and epidemiological medicine as well as evolutionary biology. Sex allocation theory oÔ¨Äers a relatively cheap and easy way to estimate selÔ¨Ång rates in natural parasite populations. Local mate competition (LMC) theory predicts that the optimal sex ratio (r*; deÔ¨Åned as proportion males) is related to the selÔ¨Ång rate (s) by the equation r*=(1-s)/2. In this paper, we generalize the application of sex allocation theory across parasitic protozoa in the phylum Apicomplexa. This cosmopolitan phylum consists entirely of parasites, and includes a number of species of medical and veterinary importance. We suggest that LMC theory should apply to eimeriorin intestinal parasites. As predicted, data from 13 eimeriorin species showed a female-biased sex ratio, with the sex ratios suggesting high levels of selÔ¨Ång (0.8-1.0). Importantly our estimate of the selÔ¨Ång rate in one of these species, Toxoplasma gondii, is in agreement with previous genetic analyses. In contrast, we predict that LMC theory will not apply to the groups in which syzygy occurs (adeleorins, gregarines and piroplasms). Syzygy occurs when a single male gametocyte and a single female gametocyte pair together physically or in close proximity, just prior to fertilization. As predicted, data from four adeleorin species showed sex ratios not signiÔ¨Åcantly diÔ¨Äerent from 0.5.},

It suggests that specialized natural enemies decrease offspring survival at high densities beneath parents, giving locally rarer species an advantage. This mechanism, in its original form, assumes that density dependence is overcompensating: mortality must be disproportionately high at the highest densities, with few offspring recruiting below their parents. We tested this assumption using parallel shadehouse and field density-series experiments on seedlings of a tropical tree, Pleradenophora longicuspis. We found strong, overcompensating mortality driven by fungal pathogens, causing 90\% (shadehouse) or 100\% (field) mortality within 4 weeks of germination, and generating a negative relationship between initial and final seedling densities. Fungicide treatment led to much lower, density-independent, mortality. Overcompensating mortality was extremely rapid, and could be missed without detailed monitoring. Such dynamics may prevent dead trees from being replaced by conspecifics, promoting coexistence as envisioned by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis.},

A model is presented that allows detailed examination of the effect of different predators, dispersal agents, seed-crop sizes, etc. on these three traits. In short, any event that increases the efficiency of the predators at eating seeds and seedlings of a given tree species may lead to a reduction in population density of the adults of that species and/or to increased distance between new adults and their parents. Either event will lead to more space in the habitat for other species of trees, and therefore higher total number of tree species, provided seed sources are available over evolutionary time. As one moves from the wet lowland tropics to the dry tropics or temperate zones, the seed and seedling predators in a habitat are hypothesized to be progressively less efficient at keeping one or a few tree species from monopolizing the habitat through competitive superiority. This lowered efficiency of the predators is brought about by the increased severity and unpredictability of the physical environment, which in turn leads to regular or erratic escape of large seed or seedling cohorts from the predators.},

We use spatially explicit simulation models and analytical approximations to evaluate how spatial scales of offspring and enemy dispersal affect species richness. In comparison with model communities in which both offspring and enemies disperse long distances, species richness is substantially decreased when offspring disperse long distances and enemies disperse short distances. In contrast, when both offspring and enemies disperse short distances species richness more than doubles and adults of each species are highly spatially clumped. For the range of conditions typical of tropical forests, locally dispersing specialist enemies may decrease species richness relative to enemies that disperse long distances. In communities where dispersal distances of both offspring and enemies are short, local effects may enhance species richness.},

To make progress in this direction, we designed several mathematical models and compared them with data from influenza A infections of mice. We find that the immune response (IR) plays an important part in the infection dynamics. Both an innate and an adaptive IR are required to provide adequate explanation of the data. In contrast, regrowth of epithelial cells did not seem to be an important mechanism on the time scale of the infection. We also find that different model variants for both innate and adaptive responses fit the data well, indicating the need for additional data to allow further model discrimination.},

The parasites of amphibians and reptiles remain the most poorly described, but the majority of undescribed species are probably parasites of birds and bony fish. Missing species are disproportionately likely to be smaller parasites of smaller hosts in undersampled countries. At current rates, it would take centuries to comprehensively sample, collect and name vertebrate helminths. While some have suggested that macroecology can work around existing data limitations, we argue that patterns described from a small, biased sample of diversity aren‚Äôt necessarily reliable, especially as host‚Äìparasite networks are increasingly altered by global change. In the spirit of moonshots like the Human Genome Project and the Global Virome Project, we consider the idea of a Global Parasite Project: a global effort to transform parasitology and inventory parasite diversity at an unprecedented pace.},

There are also many species that persist following devastating declines due to disease. The broad mechanisms that enable host persistence following declines include evolution of resistance or tolerance, changes in immunity and behaviour, compensatory recruitment, pathogen attenuation, environmental refugia, density-dependent transmission and changes in community composition. Here we examine the case of chytridiomycosis, the most important wildlife disease of the past century. We review the full breadth of mechanisms allowing host persistence, and synthesise research on host, pathogen, environmental and community factors driving persistence following chytridiomycosis-related declines and overview the current evidence and the information required to support each mechanism. We found that for most species the mechanisms facilitating persistence have not been identified. We illustrate how the mechanisms that drive long-term host population dynamics determine the most effective conservation management strategies. Therefore, understanding mechanisms of host persistence is important because many species continue to be threatened by disease, some of which will require intervention. The conceptual framework we describe is broadly applicable to other novel disease systems.},

These formed the basis of a successful breeding program in Shaanxi, China. We examined ibises in this breeding program for ectoparasites, to establish whether any of the three chewing louse species known from this host had survived this severe host population bottleneck. We recovered representatives of three species of lice, identified as the same species as those previously known from the wild populations: Ardeicola nippon, Colpocephalum nipponi, and Ibidoecus meinertzhageni. Of these, the two first species were recovered from almost all examined hosts, whereas I. meinertzhageni was more rare. As these lice are host specific, this implies that all three louse species remarkably survived this bottleneck, and are now thriving in both the reintroduced and captive populations of crested ibis. This constitutes an unintentional success story in the conservation of parasitic species. We provide the first photos of all three species, as well as a preliminary assessment of their conservation status, and discuss the future of chewing louse conservation.},

While research has traditionally focused on the direct effects of VBDs on human morbidity and mortality, it is increasingly clear that their impacts are much more pervasive. VBDs are dynamically linked to feedbacks between environmental conditions, vector ecology, disease burden, and societal responses that drive transmission. As a result, VBDs have had profound influence on human history. Mechanisms include: (1) killing or debilitating large numbers of people, with demographic and population-level impacts; (2) differentially affecting populations based on prior history of disease exposure, immunity, and resistance; (3) being weaponised to promote or justify hierarchies of power, colonialism, racism, classism and sexism; (4) catalysing changes in ideas, institutions, infrastructure, technologies and social practices in efforts to control disease outbreaks; and (5) changing human relationships with the land and environment. We use historical and archaeological evidence interpreted through an ecological lens to illustrate how VBDs have shaped society and culture, focusing on case studies from four pertinent VBDs: plague, malaria, yellow fever and trypanosomiasis. By comparing across diseases, time periods and geographies, we highlight the enormous scope and variety of mechanisms by which VBDs have influenced human history.},

We evaluated spatio-temporal patterns in anthrax mortalities in a plains zebra (Equus quagga) population in Etosha National Park, Namibia, incorporating remote-sensing and host telemetry data. A higher proportion of anthrax mortalities of herbivores was detected in open habitats than in other habitat types. Resource selection functions showed that the zebra population shifted habitat selection in response to changes in rainfall and vegetation productivity. Average to high rainfall years supported larger anthrax outbreaks, with animals congregating in preferred open habitats, while a severe drought forced animals into otherwise less preferred habitats, leading to few anthrax mortalities. Thus, the timing of anthrax outbreaks was congruent with preference for open plains habitats and a corresponding increase in pathogen exposure. Given shifts in habitat preference, the overlap in high-quality habitat and high-risk habitat is intermittent, reducing the adverse consequences for the population.},

We also examined how study attributes, including parasite type and life cycle, habitat type, study design, and whether predators were able to directly consume prey contributed to variation in the predator-prey-parasite interaction. We found that the overall effect of predation on parasitism differed between parasites and parasitoids and that whether consumptive effects were present, and whether a predator was a non-host spreader of parasites, were the most important traits predicting the parasite response.

We performed field surveys every six to eight weeks over 3 years to determine factors influencing parasite prevalence, host abundance, and associated taxa diversity. We also looked for signatures of low-salinity stress in the host by examining its response (time-to-right and gene expression) to salinity. We found salinity and temperature significantly affected parasite prevalence, with low-salinity sites (less than 10 practical salinity units (PSU)) lacking infection, and populations in moderate salinities at warmer temperatures reaching prevalence as high as 60\%. Host abundance was negatively associated with parasite prevalence. Host gene expression was plastic to acclimation salinity, but several osmoregulatory and immune-related genes demonstrated source-dependent salinity response. We identified a genetic marker that was strongly associated with salinity against a backdrop of no neutral genetic structure, suggesting possible selection on standing variation. Our study illuminates how selective trade-offs in naturally dynamic systems may shape host evolutionary ecology.},

Interactions between disturbances such as fire and disease could have especially severe effects, but experimental tests of multi-decadal changes in disturbance regimes are rare. Here, we surveyed vegetation for 35 years in a 54-year fire frequency experiment in a temperate oak savanna‚Äìforest ecotone that experienced a recent outbreak of oak wilt. Different fire regimes determined whether plots were savanna or forest by regulating tree abundance (r2 = 0.70), but disease rapidly reversed the effect of fire exclusion, increasing mortality by 765\% in unburned forests, but causing relatively minor changes in frequently burned savannas. Model simulations demonstrated that disease caused unburned forests to transition towards a unique woodland that was prone to transition to savanna if fire was reintroduced. Consequently, disease‚Äìfire interactions could shift ecosystem resilience and biome boundaries as pathogen distributions change.},

While survival was significantly higher than during the initial epidemic within all sites, protection from severe disease only existed within a narrow environmental space, suggesting host traits conducive to surviving disease are highly environmentally dependent.

	abstract = {White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a fungal disease that has caused precipitous declines in several North American bat species, creating an urgent need for conservation. We examined how microclimates and other characteristics of hibernacula have affected bat populations following WNS-associated declines and evaluated whether cooling of warm, little-used hibernacula could benefit bats. During the period following mass mortality (2013‚Äì2020), we conducted 191 winter surveys of 25 unmanipulated hibernacula and 6 manipulated hibernacula across Pennsylvania (USA). We joined these data with additional datasets on historical (pre-WNS) bat counts and on the spatial distribution of underground sites. We used generalized linear mixed models and model selection to identify factors affecting bat populations. Winter counts of Myotis lucifugus were higher and increased over time in colder hibernacula (those with midwinter temperatures of 3‚Äì6 ¬∞C) compared with warmer (7‚Äì11 ¬∞C) hibernacula. Counts of Eptesicus fuscus, Myotis leibii, and Myotis septentrionalis were likewise higher in colder hibernacula (temperature effects = ‚Äì0.73 [SE 0.15], ‚Äì0.51 [0.18], and ‚Äì0.97 [0.28], respectively). Populations of M. lucifugus and M. septentrionalis increased most over time in hibernacula surrounded by more nearby sites, whereas Eptesicus fuscus counts remained high where they had been high before WNS onset (pre-WNS high count effect = 0.59 [0.22]). Winter counts of M. leibii were higher in hibernacula with high vapor pressure deficits (VPDs) (particularly over 0.1 kPa) compared with sites with lower VPDs (VPD effect = 15.3 [4.6]). Counts of M. lucifugus and E. fuscus also appeared higher where VPD was higher. In contrast, Perimyotis subflavus counts increased over time in relatively warm hibernacula and were unaffected by VPD. Where we manipulated hibernacula, we achieved cooling of on average 2.1 ¬∞C. At manipulated hibernacula, counts of M. lucifugus and P. subflavus increased over time (years since manipulation effect = 0.70 [0.28] and 0.51 [0.15], respectively). Further, there were more E. fuscus where cooling was greatest (temperature difference effect = ‚Äì0.46 [SE 0.11]), and there was some evidence there were more P. subflavus in hibernacula sections that remained warm after manipulation. These data show bats are responding effectively to WNS through habitat selection. In M. lucifugus, M. septentrionalis, and possibly P. subflavus, this response is ongoing, with bats increasingly aggregating at suitable hibernacula, whereas E. fuscus remain in previously favored sites. Our results suggest that cooling warm sites receiving little use by bats is a viable strategy for combating WNS.},

	abstract = {Novel pathogen introduction can have drastic consequences for naive host populations, and outcomes can be difficult to predict. Evolutionary rescue (ER) provides a foundation for understanding whether hosts are driven to extinction or survive via adaptation. Currently, patterns of host population dynamics alongside evidence of adaptation are used to infer ER. However, the gap between established ER theory and complexity inherent in natural systems makes interpreting empirical patterns difficult because they can be confounded with ecological drivers of survival under current theory. To bridge this gap, we expand ER theory to include biological selective agents, such as pathogens. We find birth processes to be more important than previously theorised in determining ER potential. We employ a novel framework evaluating ER potential within natural systems and gain ability to identify system characteristics that make ER possible. Identifying these characteristics allows a shift from retrospective observation to a predictive mindset, and our findings suggest that ER occurrence may be more limited than previously thought. We use the plague system of Yersinia pestis infecting Cynomys ludovicianus (black-tailed prairie dogs) and Spermophilus beecheyi (California ground squirrels) as a case study.},

However, parasites that alter host traits may increase host density via indirect ecological interactions. Here, we show how depression of foraging rate of infected hosts can produce such a hydra effect. Using a foraging assay, we quantified reduced foraging rates of a zooplankton host infected with a virulent fungal parasite. We then parameterized a dynamical model of hosts, parasites, and resources with this foraging function, showing how foraging depression can create a hydra effect. Mathematically, the hydra arose when increased resource productivity exceeded any increase in resource consumption per host. Therefore, the foraging-mediated hydra effect more likely emerged (1) for hosts that strongly control logistic-like resources and (2) during larger epidemics of moderately virulent parasites. We then analyzed epidemics from 13 fungal epidemics in nature. We found evidence for a foraging-mediated hydra effect: large outbreaks depressed foraging rate and correlated with increased densities of both algal resources and Daphnia hosts. Therefore, depression of the foraging rate of infected hosts can produce higher host densities even during epidemics of parasites that increase host mortality. Such hydras might prevent the collapse of host populations but also could produce higher densities of infected hosts.},

Processes that operate on small spatial scales have the potential to influence dynamics at much larger scales; for example, a change in the physiology of a primary producer can alter primary productivity in an ecosystem. Similarly, evolution‚Äîa process that historically was thought of as occurring at longer timescales‚Äîcan influence ecological dynamics and vice versa. The importance of considering multiple scales is broadly true in ecology and evolution, and it is especially important for studies of disease ecology and evolution. Yet characterizing the scales at which individual studies operate is surprisingly challenging, as we (re)discovered while trying to characterize articles published in this journal over the past three decades. However, while it is difficult to determine where one scale ends and another begins, it is also clear that work that spans across a spectrum can yield insights that could not be gleaned from a narrower focus. To demonstrate this, we highlight studies previously published in this journal that show the value of working across scales. We then introduce the six articles that comprise this Focused Topic section. Together, these articles present systems, theory, and methods that provide important insights that could not have been obtained from studying a single scale in isolation.},

Increased host diversity can cause infection prevalence in a focal host to increase (amplification) or decrease (dilution). However, it is unclear what general rules govern the context-dependent effects, in part because theories for pathogens with different transmission modes have developed largely independently. Using a two-host model, we explore how the pathogen transmission mode and characteristics of a second host (disease competence and competitive ability) influence disease prevalence in a focal host. Our work shows how the theories for pathogens with environmental transmission, density-dependent direct transmission, and frequency-dependent direct transmission can be unified. Our work also identifies general rules about how host and pathogen characteristics affect amplification/dilution. For example, higher-competence hosts promote amplification, unless they are strong interspecific competitors; strong interspecific competitors promote dilution, unless they are large sources of new infections; and dilution occurs under frequency-dependent direct transmission more than density-dependent direct transmission, unless interspecific host competition is sufficiently strong. Our work helps explain how the characteristics of the pathogen and a second host affect disease prevalence in a focal host.},

Our stochastic model breaks the infection process down into the stages of parasite exposure, entry, and establishment and provides associated probabilities for a host‚Äôs ability to resist infections with barriers and clear internal infections. We tested our model on Daphnia dentifera and the parasitic fungus Metschnikowia bicuspidata and found that when faced with identical levels of parasite exposure, Daphnia patent (transmitting) infections depended on the strength of internal clearance. Applying a Gillespie algorithm to the model-estimated probabilities allowed us to visualize within-host dynamics, within which signatures of host defense could be clearly observed. We also found that early within-host stages were the most vulnerable to internal clearance, suggesting that hosts have a limited window during which recovery can occur. Our study demonstrates how pairing longitudinal infection data with a simple model can reveal new insight into within-host dynamics and mechanisms of host defense. Our model and methodological approach may be a powerful tool for exploring these properties in understudied host-parasite interactions.},

Differences in pathogen strain composition, diversity, fitness, and spatial distribution are generally ignored in epidemiological modeling and are rarely studied in natural populations, yet they may be important drivers of epidemic trajectories. To examine how these factors are linked to epidemics in natural host populations, we collected epidemiological and genetic data from 15 populations of the powdery mildew fungus, Podosphaera plantaginis, on Plantago lanceolata in the √Öland Islands, Finland. In each population, we tracked spatiotemporal disease progression throughout one epidemic season and coupled our survey of infection with intensive field sampling of the pathogen. We found that strain composition varied greatly among populations in the landscape. Within populations, strain composition was driven by the sequence of strain activity: early-active strains reached higher abundances, leading to consistent strain compositions over time. Co-occurring strains also varied in their contribution to the growth of the local epidemic, and these fitness inequalities were linked to epidemic dynamics: a higher proportion of hosts became infected in populations containing strains that were more similar in fitness. Epidemic trajectories in the populations were also linked to strain diversity and spatial dynamics: higher infection rates occurred in populations containing higher strain diversity, while spatially clustered epidemics experienced lower infection rates. Together, our results suggest that spatial and/or temporal variation in the strain composition, diversity, and fitness of pathogen populations are important factors generating variation in epidemiological trajectories among infected host populations.},

While there are many studies examining dynamics typically considered to be mutualistic that sometimes shift toward parasitism, little is known about conditions underlying shifts from parasitism toward mutualism. In lake populations, we observed that infection by a microsporidian gut symbiont sometimes conferred a reproductive advantage and other times a disadvantage to its Daphnia host. We hypothesized that the microsporidian might benefit its host by reducing infection by more virulent parasites, which attack via the gut. In a laboratory study using field-collected animals, we found that spores of a virulent fungal parasite were much less capable of penetrating the guts of Daphnia harboring the microsporidian gut symbiont. We predicted that this altered gut penetrability could cause differential impacts on host fitness depending on ecological context. Field survey data revealed that microsporidian-infected Daphnia hosts experienced a reproductive advantage when virulent parasites were common while resource scarcity led to a reproductive disadvantage, but only in lakes where virulent parasites were relatively rare. Our findings highlight the importance of considering multiparasite community context and resource availability in host-parasite studies and open the door for future research into conditions driving shifts along parasitism to mutualism gradients.},

Previous research has examined how environmental transmission influences the selective pressures shaping the virulence of pathogens that cannot reproduce in environmental reservoirs, yet many pathogens of humans, crop plants, and livestock can reproduce in these environments. We build on this work to examine how reproduction in reservoirs influences disease dynamics and virulence evolution in a simple facultative pathogen model. We use adaptive dynamics to examine the evolutionary dynamics of facultative pathogens under potential trade-offs between transmission and virulence, shedding and virulence, and reservoir persistence and virulence. We then perform critical function analysis to generalize the results independent of specific trade-off assumptions. We determine that diverse virulence strategies, sometimes resulting from evolutionary bistability or evolutionary branching conditions, are expected for facultative pathogens.

Here we ask, Can eco-evo theory explain population cycles in the field? We compared the ability of eco-evo models and classical ‚Äúeco-only‚Äù models to explain data on cycles in the insect Lymantria dispar, in which outbreaks of the insect are terminated by a fatal baculovirus. We carried out a statistical comparison of the ability of eco-only and eco-evo models to explain combined data from L. dispar outbreak cycles and baculovirus epizootics (epidemics in animals). Both models require high host variation in resistance to explain the epizootic data, but high host variation in the eco-evo model leads to consistently accurate predictions of outbreak cycles, whereas in the presence of high host variation the eco-only model can explain outbreak cycles only by invoking high levels of stochasticity, which leads to highly variable and often inaccurate predictions of outbreak cycles. Our work provides statistically robust evidence that eco-evo models can explain population cycles in the field.},

But for diseases transmitted via casual contact, contagiousness arises from a plethora of social and physiological factors, so epidemiologists have tended to rely on population averages to assess a disease's potential to spread. A new analysis of outbreak data shows that individual differences in infectiousness exert powerful influences on the epidemiology of ten deadly diseases. SARS and measles (and perhaps avian influenza) show strong tendencies towards ‚Äòsuperspreading events‚Äô that can ignite explosive epidemics ‚Äî but this same volatility makes outbreaks more likely to fizzle out. Smallpox and pneumonic plague, two potential bioterrorism agents, show steadier growth but still differ markedly from the traditional average-based view. These findings are relevant to how emerging diseases are detected and controlled.},

	abstract = {The seasonal influenza A virus undergoes rapid evolution to escape human immune response. Adaptive changes occur primarily in antigenic epitopes, the antibody-binding domains of the viral hemagglutinin. This process involves recurrent selective sweeps, in which clusters of simultaneous nucleotide fixations in the hemagglutinin coding sequence are observed about every 4 years. Here, we show that influenza A (H3N2) evolves by strong clonal interference. This mode of evolution is a red queen race between viral strains with different beneficial mutations. Clonal interference explains and quantifies the observed sweep pattern: we find an average of at least one strongly beneficial amino acid substitution per year, and a given selective sweep has three to four driving mutations on average. The inference of selection and clonal interference is based on frequency time series of single-nucleotide polymorphisms, which are obtained from a sample of influenza genome sequences over 39 years. Our results imply that mode and speed of influenza evolution are governed not only by positive selection within, but also by background selection outside antigenic epitopes: immune adaptation and conservation of other viral functions interfere with each other. Hence, adapting viral proteins are predicted to be particularly brittle. We conclude that a quantitative understanding of influenza‚Äôs evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics must be based on all genomic domains and functions coupled by clonal interference.},

By mapping the multi-strain Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model onto the traveling wave model of adapting populations, we demonstrate that persistence of a rapidly evolving, Red-Queen-like state of the pathogen population requires long-ranged cross-immunity and sufficiently large population sizes. This state is unstable and the population goes extinct or ‚Äòspeciates‚Äô into two pathogen strains with antigenic divergence beyond the range of cross-inhibition. However, in a certain range of evolutionary parameters, a single cross-inhibiting population can exist for times long compared to the time to the most recent common ancestor (TM‚Å¢R‚Å¢C‚Å¢A) and gives rise to phylogenetic patterns typical of influenza virus. We demonstrate that the rate of speciation is related to fluctuations of TM‚Å¢R‚Å¢C‚Å¢A and construct a ‚Äòphase diagram‚Äô identifying different phylodynamic regimes as a function of evolutionary parameters.},

Here we show that both Red Queen processes can operate simultaneously by analysing the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in guppies (Poecilia reticulata and P. obscura) and swamp guppies (Micropoecilia picta). Sub-functionalisation of MHC alleles into ‚Äòsupertypes‚Äô explains how polymorphisms persist during rapid host‚Äìparasite co-evolution. Simulations show the maintenance of supertypes as balanced polymorphisms, consistent with Red Queen dynamics, whereas alleles within supertypes are subject to positive selection in a Red Queen arms race.

Virus phylogenies have been used in many recent studies to infer properties of epidemics. These approaches rely on coalescent models that may not be appropriate for infectious diseases. We account for phylogenetic patterns of viruses in susceptible‚Äìinfected (SI), susceptible‚Äìinfected‚Äìsusceptible (SIS), and susceptible‚Äìinfected‚Äìrecovered (SIR) models of infectious disease, and our approach may be a viable alternative to demographic models used to reconstruct epidemic dynamics. The method allows epidemiological parameters, such as the reproductive number, to be estimated directly from viral sequence data. We also describe patterns of phylogenetic clustering that are often construed as arising from a short chain of transmissions. Our model reproduces the moments of the distribution of phylogenetic cluster sizes and may therefore serve as a null hypothesis for cluster sizes under simple epidemiological models. We examine a small cross-sectional sample of human immunodeficiency (HIV)-1 sequences collected in the United States and compare our results to standard estimates of effective population size. Estimated prevalence is consistent with estimates of effective population size and the known history of the HIV epidemic. While our model accurately estimates prevalence during exponential growth, we find that periods of decline are harder to identify.},

	abstract = {The Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) population in the British Isles increased rapidly from the 1800s to 1950 due to climatic amelioration, predator reduction and agricultural changes. It became the major vertebrate pest of agriculture, causing an estimated ¬£50 million in damage and lost production each year. Myxomatosis reached Britain in 1954-55 causing 99-9\% mortality in some Rabbit populations and, carried by the mosquito and flea vectors, the disease spread rapidly. The consequent decline in the Rabbit population caused dramatic changes in agriculture and the native fauna and flora. It promoted woodland regeneration and increased grassland and cereal production; herb and grass height increased, flowering was noticeable and plant successions ensued. Some small legumes and annual plants became extinct locally and much floristically rich vegetation became dominated by a few grass species or shrubs. The increased grass growth probably promoted an increase in the number of many invertebrate species as well as in the vole (Microrus agrestis). Some species of insect became reduced in number and the Large Blue Butterfly (Maculinea arion) has become extinct (1979) since the decline of the ant (Myrmica spp.) fauna necessary to rear the butterfly larvae. Breeding sites for the Sand Lizard (Lacerta ugilis), Stone Curlew (Burhinus oedicnemus) and Wheatear (Oenanrhe oenanthe) have been reduced by habitat change. Immediately after myxomatosis many predator populations suffered from a lack of Rabbit prey with consequent poor breeding success, but those able to switch to voles, and other predators which are no longer taken in Rabbit trapping, have increased in numbers, e.g. Fox (Vulpes vulpes), Polecat (Mustela putorius), Short-eared Owl (Asio Barnmeus) and Kestrel (Falco tinnunculus). Others such as the Stoat (Mustela ermineu) and the Buzzard (Buteo buteo) declined immediately after myxomatosis through lack of prey and have recovered in nubers only slowly; the Peregrine falcon population has declined partly as a result of lack of open habitat. The breeding success of many predators was also reduced. Parasites of the Rabbit also declined; the flea (Spilopsyllus cuniculi), roundworms and tapeworms, as well as coccidiosis carried by Rabbits and particularly affecting young hares (Lepus europaeus) were all considered to be affected. Species such as the Pheasant Phasianus spp., the hare and the Roe Deer (Capreolus capreolus) increased their use of woodland habitat and/or benefited from the increased food available. Rats (Rartus nomegicus) appeared to decline following increased predation and loss of habitat. In Australia similar vegetational changes occurred in many areas after the introduction of myxomatosis and predators such as the Fox and Wedge-tailed Eagle (Aquila audax) were reduced by control measures following increased predation on sheep. Many bird and marsupial species were reduced in number after the loss of Rabbit prey or on becoming an alternative prey item. In Britain the loss of the fur industry has been outweighed economically by the increased agricultural production and reduced control and maintenance costs following myxomatosis. Since myxomatosis appeared Rabbit numbers have increased only slowly, probably because of increased predator pressure on low density populations and the periodic recurrence of the disease. Rabbit behaviour may have changed so that burrows are not used as much as in the past, Rabbit trapping has ceased and many habitats have been lost. Rabbit numbers could still reach moderate densities but a reversal of many of the ecological effects of my xomatosis is unlikely.},

We use a mathematical approach to show that harvesting can lead to compensatory growth due to a release from disease-induced mortality. Our findings imply that culling in systems that harbor virulent parasites can reduce disease prevalence and increase population density. Our models predict that this compensation occurs for a broad range of infectious disease characteristics unless the disease induces long-lasting immunity in hosts. Our key insight is that a population can be regulated at a similar density by disease or at reduced prevalence by a combination of culling and disease. We illustrate our predictions with a system-specific model representing wild boar tuberculosis infection, parameterized for central Spain, and find significant compensation to culling. Given that few wildlife diseases are likely to induce long-lived immunity, populations with virulent diseases may often be resilient to harvesting},

The impact of this pathogen, however, varies markedly among amphibian species and populations. Following invasion into some areas of California's Sierra Nevada, Bd leads to rapid declines and local extinctions of frog populations (Rana muscosa, R. sierrae). In other areas, infected populations of the same frog species have declined but persisted at low host densities for many years. We present results of a 5-year study showing that infected adult frogs in persistent populations have low fungal loads, are surviving between years, and frequently lose and regain the infection. Here we put forward the hypothesis that fungal load dynamics can explain the different population-level outcomes of Bd observed in different areas of the Sierra Nevada and possibly throughout the world. We develop a model that incorporates the biological details of the Bd-host interaction. Importantly, model results suggest that host persistence versus extinction does not require differences in host susceptibility, pathogen virulence, or environmental conditions, and may be just epidemic and endemic population dynamics of the same host‚Äìpathogen system. The different disease outcomes seen in natural populations may result solely from density-dependent host‚Äìpathogen dynamics. The model also shows that persistence of Bd is enhanced by the long-lived tadpole stage that characterize these two frog species, and by nonhost Bd reservoirs.},

A detailed long-term study on the impact of the direct life-cycle nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus on a breeding population of laboratory mice provides a clear example of the ability of helminths to regulate host abundance. In the absence of the parasite, the mouse population equilibrated at a density of 320 mice/m2 as a result of density-dependent effects on recruitment. When the parasite was added and transmission was maintained at high levels, infected mouse populations equilibrated at densities of {\textless} 18 mice/m2. Reduced rates of parasite transmission and elimination of the parasite from the system both resulted in an increase in mouse density. These results have implications for both ecology and parasitology as they demonstrate a potentially important but often ignored component of host populations that may well influence host abundance and community structure.},

Conservation of such species may depend upon successful outplantings of young cacti in places that minimize attack rates by Cactoblastis. This paper discusses how to maximize the success rates of such outplantings of the endangered semaphore cactus, O. corallicola Small. A 1998 outplanting of 180 cacti in the Lower Keys showed that planting close to Opuntia stricta (Haw.) Haworth infected with Cactoblastis results in heavy losses, as Cactoblastis bleed over from O. stricta to attack outplanted O. corallicola. Growth rates of outplanted O. corallicola are greatest in shade conditions, but attack rates by Cactoblastis are also greater in the shade. An outplanting of 240 O. corallicola cacti on six different Keys in 2000, all far away from O. stricta, had no Cactoblastis related mortality. The most successful conservation strategy for O. corallicola thus appears to be outplanting in the shade, possibly in tropical hammocks, far away from Opuntia cacti that might contain Cactoblastis. /// La presencia de la especie Cactoblastis cactorum (Berg) representa una amenaza real para las especies de Opuntia que se encuentran en peligro de extinci√≥n y que ocurren en los Cayos de Florida (Florida Keys). La conservaci√≥n y supervivencia de estas especies podria depender de la efectividad en establecer parcelas plantadas con estas especies en areas donde el possible ataque de Cactoblastis sea m√≠nimo. Este articulo discute algunas de las maneras en que se pueden maximizar las probabilidades de supervivencia de parcelas plantadas con O. corallicola Small. Por ejemplo, una parcela plantada en 1998 con 180 especimenes de O. corallicola en un area cercana a especimenes de O. stricta (Haw.) Haworth infestadas con Cactoblastis demostr√≥ que este insecto se dispers√≥ hacia los especimenes O. corallicola causando grandes da√±os. La tasa de crecimiento en O. corallicola es maxima cuando las areas en donde se encuentra son sombreadas; sin embargo, el da√±o causado por Cactoblastis tambi√©n se maximiza en areas sin sol. Al examinar 240 especimenes de una parcela plantada con O. corallicola en diferentes isles del los Cayos de Florida, en areas sin O. stricta, no se encontro da√±o causado por Cactoblastis. Por lo tanto, la estrategia mas prometedora en cuanto a la conservaci√≥n de O. corallicola parece ser la localizaci√≥n de parcelas de esta especie en areas sombreadas y libres de la presencia de O. stricta que puedan encontrarse infestadas con Cactoblastis.},

	abstract = {Aim To relate the recent Iberian lynx decline to changes in the distribution of the European rabbit after the haemorrhagic disease outbreak of 1989. As Iberian rabbits evolved in two geographically separated lineages, being the recent lynx range practically restricted to the southwestern lineage, we also test if differential range dynamics exists for these lineages, with the consequent implications for lynx conservation and reintroduction planning. Location The Iberian Peninsula. Methods We modelled environmental favourability for the lynx based on its distribution before 1989, and for the rabbit using distribution data collected primarily after 1989, and validated them using independent abundance data. We compared both models and combined them in a lynx occurrence forecast. We correlated the prevalence of southwestern rabbit lineage with the environmental favourability for the rabbit. Results The environmental lynx model correlated with past lynx abundance data, but did not reflect its recent strong range contraction. The rabbit model correlated with recent rabbit abundance, but was negatively correlated with the environmental model for the lynx. The combination of both models forecasted lynx occurrence in a few separated nuclei, which encompass all recent lynx records. The prevalence of rabbit's southwestern lineage correlated negatively with favourability for the rabbit. Main conclusions The region to which the lynx became confined before 1989 is currently less favourable for rabbits, whereas more favourable areas remain outside lynx reach. This differential favourability correlates with rabbit phylogeographical structure, suggesting that the southwestern lineage is facing more unfavourable conditions or is less resilient to recent diseases. The loss of concordance between lynx distribution and the whole rabbit phylogeographical structure has prevented lynx persistence in northeastern rabbit lineage areas, which should be considered in lynx reintroduction planning. Similar conservation problems could affect other ecologically interacting species whose distributions‚Äô overlapping has sharply diminished.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The cactus moth, Cactoblastis cactorum (Berg) (Phycitidae) is native to South America. It was released as a biological control agent against alien Opuntia-cacti in Australia in the 1920s, then in southern Africa, and latterly on several islands, including those in the Caribbean. In 1989, the cactus moth was discovered in Florida, in the United States of America, where it is now threatening the survival of indigenous Opuntia species. In this paper we identify some of the attributes that have contributed to the success of C. cactorum as a weed biological control agent. Many of these same qualities account for the problems that C. cactorum has caused in Florida and predispose it as a major threat to the speciose, native Opuntia-floras of Central and North America. An estimated 79 platyopuntia (prickly pear) species are at risk: 51 species endemic to Mexico; nine species endemic to the United States; and 19 species common to both countries. Many cultivated and wild Opuntia species, that are used in various ways, are also vulnerable to attack by C. cactorum, including at least 25 species in Mexico and three species in the United States, particularly the widely exploited and culturally important cultivars of O. ficus-indica. Some control strategies are suggested that may minimize the risk and consequences of invasion by the cactus moth. The wider implications of this threat to the practice of weed biological control and to conservation are discussed.},

	abstract = {Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) has become established in wild rabbit populations throughout Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand. The abundance of wild rabbits has been significantly reduced, particularly in drier areas of southern Spain, inland Australia and South Island New Zealand. A detailed knowledge of the epidemiology of RHD is essential for the management of the disease in natural rabbit populations, either to rebuild or to control populations. When RHD first spread among naive wild rabbits, epidemiological studies provided unique information on the rate of spread, the possible role of insect vectors in transmission, and the correlation between the impact of disease on populations and climatic variables. Current research shows a consistent pattern of epidemiology between Europe and Australasia. Typically, the most severe epizootics of RHD occur among young sub-adult rabbits which have lost age-related resilience and maternal antibodies. However, the timing of these outbreaks reflects climatic variables that determine the breeding season of the rabbits and the periods when RHD virus (RDHV) is most likely to persist and spread. Further factors that may complicate epidemiology include the possibility that non-pathogenic RHDV-like viruses are present in natural rabbit populations. Additionally, the question of how the virus persists from year to year remains unresolved; persistence in carrier rabbits is a possibility. Understanding of the epidemiology of RHD is now sufficiently advanced to consider the possibility of manipulating rabbit populations to alter the epidemiological pattern of RHD and thereby maximise or minimise the mortality caused by the disease. Altering the epidemiology of RHD in this manner would assist the management of wild rabbit populations either for conservation or pest control purposes.},

	abstract = {1 Harbour seals Phoca vitulina in eastern England were heavily exploited in the 1960s and 1970s, and affected by phocine distemper virus (PDV) epidemics in 1988 and 2002. Information on their historical and current status is required for their management. To maximize the effectiveness of limited population survey effort we need to both estimate and minimize error. 2 Presented here are data from annual aerial surveys of the population. Sporadic, synoptic surveys in The Wash, England, were used with more frequent counts of subpopulations in the Moray Firth, Scotland, to determine optimum timing of surveys. 3 We developed models that explicitly account for variability in both observation and population growth processes to show that the proportion of animals observed is much more variable than the annual growth rates. The latter can therefore be treated as constant within each period, and estimated along with the epidemic mortalities during the study and the precision of the survey results. 4 The Wash population increased at around 3¬∑1\% per annum (pa) [95\% confidence interval (CI) 2¬∑1‚Äì4¬∑1] between 1973 and 1988. It fell by approximately 52\% (95\% CI 44‚Äì59) as a result of the 1988 PDV epidemic, and subsequently increased at 5¬∑7\% pa (95\% CI 4¬∑8‚Äì6¬∑7). These growth rates were below those reported for European mainland populations, but showed no indication of density-dependent effects. 5 The recurrence of PDV in 2002 caused approximately 22\% mortality (95\% CI 9‚Äì33), significantly less than the 1988 epidemic and less than half that in European mainland populations in 2002. 6 Synthesis and applications. Combining sparse, systematic survey data with sporadic counts produced robust estimates of growth rates and epidemic mortality. The results indicate the value of even limited and sporadic survey effort for monitoring populations. The study has highlighted significant differences in both population dynamics and the severity of disease events between English and European harbour seal populations.},

Here, we summarize published information on the occurrence of mass mortalities among marine mammals and review the mathematical models that have been developed to investigate the role of such disasters in population dynamics. We conclude that mass mortalities may play a more important role than density-dependent factors in the dynamics of some marine mammal populations. This, in combination with recent improvements in our understanding of the structure of these populations, has important implications for their genetics and evolution.},

	abstract = {Invasive organisms and emerging wildlife disease pose two of the greatest threats to global biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Typically, when parasites are considered in invasion biology, it is in the context of the enemy release hypothesis, wherein a non-indigenous species has greater probability of invasion success by virtue of leaving its natural enemies, including parasites, behind. It is also possible that native parasites may prevent invasions, but it is clear that invasive organisms may bring infectious diseases with them that can infect native competitors (via spillover), or act as competent hosts for native diseases, increasing disease prevalence among native species (via spillback). If the shared disease (either via spillover or spillback) has higher virulence in the native host (which is particularly likely with introduced parasites), there is the potential that the disease can act as a ‚Äòbiological weapon‚Äô leading to a disease-mediated invasion (DMI). Here, we review cases where disease may have been an important factor mediating a wide range of invasions in vertebrates, invertebrates and plants. We then focus on the invasion of the grey squirrel into the UK as a case study of a DMI, and we discuss how mathematical models have helped us to understand the importance of this shared disease and its implications for the management of invasive species. We conclude that (i) DMIs are a widespread phenomenon, that (ii) spillover is more common in animal invasions and spillback more common among plant invasions and that (iii) spillover DMIs are particularly important in explaining the replacement of native animals with phylogenetically similar non-indigenous species.},

But how can these so-called Red-Queen dynamics be tracked through time? By stirring around in the slime at the bottom of a pond, it turns out. The water flea Daphnia and one of its microbial parasites are both able to survive many years dormant in lake mud. In a study that compared revived dormant stages of host and parasite from the sediment beneath a pond in Heverlee, Belgium, with present-day descendants, there was steady increase in parasite virulence through time. But to little overall effect: infection rates between the hosts and their parasite contemporaries remained much the same: as in many an 'arms race', the result is a stalemate.},

This model predicts that variation for disease resistance will be transient, and that host populations generally will be monomorphic at disease-resistance (R -gene) loci. However, plant populations show considerable polymorphism at R -gene loci involved in pathogen recognition2. Here we have tested the arms-race model in Arabidopsis thaliana by analysing sequences flanking Rpm1, a gene conferring the ability to recognize Pseudomonas pathogens carrying AvrRpm1 orAvrB (ref. 3). We reject the arms-race hypothesis: resistance andsusceptibility alleles at this locus have co-existed for millions of years. To account for the age of alleles and the relative levels ofpolymorphism within allelic classes, we use coalescence theory to model the long-term accumulation of nucleotide polymorphism in the context of the short-term ecological dynamics of disease resistance. This analysis supports a ‚Äòtrench warfare‚Äô hypothesis, inwhich advances and retreats of resistance-allele frequency maintain variation for disease resistance as a dynamic polymorphism4,5.},

Recent theoretical and empirical work has greatly improved our understanding of the evolutionary processes affecting local infectivity adaptation. However, in spite of the attention paid to the evolution of virulence, only a few recent models have explicitly studied spatial variation in optimal virulence. Our understanding of parasite local adaptation will continue to improve through studies of the genetic basis of infectivity, research on spatial variation in optimal virulence in multiple-deme systems, and the combination of these two interacting components of parasite infection in theoretical and empirical studies.},

In particular, they assume that each host is exposed to a single infectious propagule, regardless of the parasite‚Äôs prevalence. On the other hand, standard epidemiological models usually assume that all hosts are equally susceptible to infection. Here, we summarise models in which we relax these simplifying assumptions, thereby allowing for feedbacks between evolution, ecology, and epidemiology. One major result from these models is that, under certain general conditions, a parasite‚Äôs potential for disease spread (R0) decreases as genetic diversity for resistance increases in the host population. Moreover, R0 can increase if we allow the parasite population to track common host genotypes. Feedbacks between ecology and evolution mean that as a common genotype comes to dominate the host population, the parasite population adapts to preferentially infect this genotype, increasing the prevalence of infection and the mean number of parasite exposures per host. We further connect these findings to the major evolutionary hypothesis that coevolving parasites can favour sexual reproduction.},

	abstract = {Predators may control the impact of herbivores on their plant resources by 1) decreasing herbivore numbers, 2) imposing predation risk affecting foraging behavior. The goal of the present study was to examine the effects of a predator and auditory cues indicating its presence on the rate of tree seedling (Acer rubrum, Betula lenta) consumption by meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus). The first of our experiments involved introduction of a stoat (Mustela erminea) into an enclosed vole population and the second a playback of recordings of vole distress calls, movements of a stoat and its vocalizations. In both experiments we manipulated vegetation cover and the availability of food next to the experimental seedlings to assess the effects of microhabitat under the different risk situations. The results of the first unreplicated experiment suggested an increased rate of seedling predation in the presence of the stoat. Consistent with these results, the playback of predator sounds in the second replicated experiment caused an increased rate of seedling predation compared to control plots with no recordings. A mowed circle around a seedling station, representing increased risk of predation on the voles, decreased seedling consumption. This effect was modest in the playback treatment. We suggest the results to be due to displacement behavior by the voles exposed to prolonged risk and conflicting demands of foraging and avoiding predators. Alternatively, as suggested by the model of Lima and Bednekoff, prolonged risk of predation forced the voles to decrease their levels of vigilance during low-risk playback breaks. The modest inhibitory effect of cover removal on seedling predation in the playback treatment is consistent with this interpretation. The results confirm recent evidence for trophic cascades mediated by behavioral interactions between predator and prey. They are novel in suggesting that the presence of predation risk can increase the inhibitory effects of consumers on their resources.},

	abstract = {In most aquatic ecosystems, fishes are hosts to parasites and, sometimes, these parasites can affect fish biology. Some of the most dramatic cases occur when fishes are intermediate hosts for larval parasites. For example, fishes in southern California estuaries are host to many parasites. The most common of these parasites, Euhaplorchis californiensis, infects the brain of the killifish Fundulus parvipinnis and alters its behaviour, making the fish 10‚Äì30 times more susceptible to predation by the birds that serve as its definitive host. Parasites like E. californiensis are embedded in food webs because they require trophic transmission. In the Carpinteria Salt Marsh estuarine food web, parasites dominate the links and comprise substantial amount of biomass. Adding parasites to food webs alters important network statistics such as connectance and nestedness. Furthermore, some free-living stages of parasites are food items for free-living species. For instance, fishes feed on trematode cercariae. Being embedded in food webs makes parasites sensitive to changes in the environment. In particular, fishing and environmental disturbance, by reducing fish populations, may reduce parasite populations. Indirect evidence suggests a decrease in parasites in commercially fished species over the past three decades. In addition, environmental degradation can affect fish parasites. For these reasons, parasites in fishes may serve as indicators of environmental impacts.},

The need to purge deleterious mutations from the genome is one possible driving force. For this idea to be valid, deleterious mutations would probably need to exhibit negative epistasis ‚Äî that is, they would act synergistically to produce a large cumulative effect. However, experimental evidence suggests that such negative epistasis is uncommon. Now, by invoking a concept called Hill‚ÄìRobertson interference, Peter Keightley and Sarah Otto have developed a computer simulation that selects for recombination regardless of whether deleterious mutations exhibit epistasis. This provides a robust explanation for the evolution of recombination, and perhaps of sex.},

	abstract = {A classification of hypotheses on the advantage of amphimixis over apomixis is presented. According to ‚ÄúImmediate Benefit‚Äù hypotheses, amphimixis is advantageous regardless of reciprocal gene exchange, because either it directly increases fitness of the progeny, reduces the deleterious mutation rate, or makes selection more efficient. In contrast, ‚ÄúVariation and Selection‚Äù hypotheses attribute the advantage of amphimixis to the reciprocal gene exchange that alters genetic variability and response to selection among the progeny. Most such hypotheses assume that amphimixis increases variability and efficiency of selection, but some claim that amphimixis decreases response to selection. Variation and Selection hypotheses require that some factor, either random drift or epistatic selection, makes distributions of different alleles nonindependent, while another factor, either changes of the genotype fitnesses or deleterious mutations, makes overrepresented genotypes non-optimal. Numerous Variation and Selection hypotheses, dealing with either unstructured or spatially structured populations, are reviewed. Two of them seem most plausible: better responsiveness of the amphimictic population to widely fluctuating selection, and lower mutation load in the amphimictic population under synergistic selection against deleterious mutations. In both cases the large advantage of amphimixis requires rather stringent conditions, which could be falsified by careful experiment. Further progress in understanding the evolution of amphimixis will depend mostly on such experimental work.},

	abstract = {Negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS) is an evolutionary mechanism suggested to govern host-parasite coevolution and the maintenance of genetic diversity at host resistance loci, such as the vertebrate MHC and R-genes in plants. Matching-allele interactions of hosts and parasites that prevent the emergence of host and parasite genotypes that are universally resistant and infective are a genetic mechanism predicted to underpin NFDS. The underlying genetics of matching-allele interactions are unknown even in host-parasite systems with empirical support for coevolution by NFDS, as is the case for the planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna and the bacterial pathogen Pasteuria ramosa. We fine-map one locus associated with D. magna resistance to P. ramosa and genetically characterize two haplotypes of the Pasteuria resistance (PR-) locus using de novo genome and transcriptome sequencing. Sequence comparison of PR-locus haplotypes finds dramatic structural polymorphisms between PR-locus haplotypes including a large portion of each haplotype being composed of non-homologous sequences resulting in haplotypes differing in size by 66 kb. The high divergence of PR-locus haplotypes suggest a history of multiple, diverse and repeated instances of structural mutation events and restricted recombination. Annotation of the haplotypes reveals striking differences in gene content. In particular, a group of glycosyltransferase genes that is present in the susceptible but absent in the resistant haplotype. Moreover, in natural populations, we find that the PR-locus polymorphism is associated with variation in resistance to different P. ramosa genotypes, pointing to the PR-locus polymorphism as being responsible for the matching-allele interactions that have been previously described for this system. Our results conclusively identify a genetic basis for the matching-allele interaction observed in a coevolving host-parasite system and provide a first insight into its molecular basis.},

	abstract = {How a host fights infection depends on an ordered sequence of steps, beginning with attempts to prevent a pathogen from establishing an infection, through to steps that mitigate a pathogen's control of host resources or minimize the damage caused during infection. Yet empirically characterizing the genetic basis of these steps remains challenging. Although each step is likely to have a unique genetic and environmental signature, and may therefore respond to selection in different ways, events that occur earlier in the infection process can mask or overwhelm the contributions of subsequent steps. In this study, we dissect the genetic architecture of a stepwise infection process using a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping approach. We control for variation at the first line of defence against a bacterial pathogen and expose downstream genetic variability related to the host's ability to mitigate the damage pathogens cause. In our model, the water-flea Daphnia magna, we found a single major effect QTL, explaining 64\% of the variance, that is linked to the host's ability to completely block pathogen entry by preventing their attachment to the host oesophagus; this is consistent with the detection of this locus in previous studies. In susceptible hosts allowing attachment, however, a further 23 QTLs, explaining between 5\% and 16\% of the variance, were mapped to traits related to the expression of disease. The general lack of pleiotropy and epistasis for traits related to the different stages of the infection process, together with the wide distribution of QTLs across the genome, highlights the modular nature of a host's defence portfolio, and the potential for each different step to evolve independently. We discuss how isolating the genetic basis of individual steps can help to resolve discussion over the genetic architecture of host resistance.},

Its particular expression is often explained as the result of a tradeoff between avoiding antagonists and acquiring resources. However, there is need for a broader perspective on this behavior, as organisms are often simultaneously involved in complex antagonistic relationships with multiple types of enemies. We show experimentally that a tradeoff between predator and parasite avoidance may be important in the evolution of habitat selection behavior in the waterflea, Daphnia magna. In this species, negatively phototactic clones suffer less from visually hunting predators by residing in deeper and darker portions of the water column during the day. However, this behavior increases the risk of parasitic infections when the Daphnia are exposed to pond sediments containing parasite spores. Positively phototactic clones, which are at a higher risk of predation, are less exposed to parasite spores in the sediment and consequently suffer less from parasitic infection. We show that the increased risk of infection remains even if the animals change their phototactic behavior on exposure to chemical cues from fish. This tradeoff highlights a substantial cost of predator-induced changes in habitat selection behavior. Tradeoffs caused by multiple enemies may explain genetic polymorphism for habitat selection behavior in many natural populations.},

	abstract = {Some organisms enforce ‚Äúmaladaptive‚Äù behaviours on others of the same or different species by imposing costs in the absence of compliance. Such enforcement is used by the enforcer to obtain benefits in the possession of the enforced individual. This mechanism is known as mafia behaviour in humans, but may be widespread in parasite‚Äìhost relationships in nature, from the cellular level to societies. In this paper we describe the evolution of such mafia mechanisms, and we propose a fuzzy logic model where the mafia mechanism is based on enforcement of hosts by exponentially increasing the cost of resistance to the parasite. The benefits of host resistance can be counteracted by parasite virulence, or even a decrease in response to an increment in its resistance. This parasite response to the host defence increment can be used for the parasite to teach the host that it is better to pay part of its benefits than increase its extremely costly defence. This model differs from others because it takes into account the evolution of host defence related to the evolution of parasite virulence (host‚Äìparasite coevolution) and points out an optimum in host defence related to the facultative virulence of the parasite. We provide several potential examples of facultative virulence depending on the antiparasite responses of hosts, and we suggest that this kind of mafia behaviour may be a widespread mechanism in biological processes at a number of different levels.},

To understand under which conditions it will be beneficial for a host to cooperate, we model the interaction between hosts and parasites as an evolutionary game. In our model, the host's behavior is plastic, and thus, its response depends on the previous interactions with the parasite. We find that such learned behavior in turn is crucial for the evolution of retaliating parasites. The abundance of this kind of mafia behavior oscillates in time and does not settle to an equilibrium. Our results suggest that retaliation is a mechanism for the parasite to evade specialization and to induce acceptance by the host.},

	abstract = {Coevolutionary theory predicts that parasitism selects for defensive traits in the hosts that counteract the negative effects of parasites. Such antagonistic interactions may continuously coevolve within cycles without end, or result in host specialization and speciation of parasites. Here, we argue that particularities of brood parasite‚Äìhost systems explain whether the coevolutionary relationships result in parasite specialization and speciation. Highlighted particularities of the system are (1) virulence of the parasites, (2) the ability of parasites to alter host behaviour, (3) the relative importance of defensive tolerance and defensive resistance of hosts, and (4) phenotypic plasticity of parasite virulence and host resistance. Fixed virulence of parasites selects for fixed resistance of hosts and both enhance the process of specialization and speciation of parasites. In contrast, phenotypic plasticity in virulence of the parasites would select for tolerance and facultative resistance in their hosts. These host characteristics imply limited escalation in resistance defences and therefore would facilitate continuous coevolutionary cycles preventing parasite specialization. Thus, when studying the diversification of brood parasites within the avian phylogeny, considering these three factors would help us understand what drives their evolution. To illustrate the importance of virulence, phenotypic plasticity and defensive tolerance for the evolution of parasites, we compare evolutionary radiation experienced by the genus Clamator and the Tribe Cuculinii, which includes the genus Cuculus, and speculate whether particularities of brood parasitism by the great spotted cuckoo, Clamator glandarius, and the common cuckoo, Cuculus canorus, explain differences in evolutionary radiation experienced by these two groups of brood parasites. ¬© 2017},

	abstract = {A theoretical framework is proposed on which some hypotheses related to the impact of imperfect vaccines on the evolution of HIV virulence can be tested. For this, a linear increase of risk behaviour with vaccine eÔ¨Äicacy is assumed. This is based on the hypothesis that people are prone to relax preventive measures by knowing that they and their partners are vaccinated and that this eÔ¨Äect is more intense the more eÔ¨Äective the vaccine is known to be. An additional, and perhaps more important hypothesis is related to the theoretical possibility that increased risk behaviour of some vaccinated individuals in partially protected populations could act as a selective pressure toward more virulent HIV strains. Those hypotheses were tested by a mathematical model that considers three diÔ¨Äerent HIV strains competing against each other in a population partially protected by imperfect vaccines of distinct eÔ¨Äicacies. Simulations of the model demonstrated that, under the above hypotheses, there is a shift in HIV virulence towards more aggressive strains with increase in vaccine eÔ¨Äicacy, associated with a marked reduction in the total amount of transmission and, consequently, in the prevalence of HIV. Potential ways for further testing the theory/model and the implications of the results are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Mathematical methods: Spatially explicit host parasite models with local and global interactions, analysed by pair approximation and simulation. Pairwise invasibility plots. Key assumptions: Infected and susceptible hosts are arranged on a regular lattice. Infection can occur locally or globally with some probability. The proportion of long-distance infection and parasite life-history traits evolve by small mutations between haploid strains. There is no explicit cost to long-distance dispersal. Conclusions: An intermediate degree of long-distance infection always evolves. This is due to a balance between the advantages from long-distance dispersal (avoiding local competition for susceptible hosts) and costs to dispersal (that emerge from the spatial heterogeneity of the hosts). Evolution maximizes parasite transmission rate in a spatially structured host population when parasite dispersal can also evolve. The evolution of parasite dispersal may lead to the concurrent evolution of higher parasite transmission and virulence than found in completely mixed populations. Interactions between the completely local and global are therefore important.},

	abstract = {Several evolutionary processes inÔ¨Çuence virulence, the amount of damage a parasite causes to its host. For example, parasites are favored to exploit their hosts prudently to prolong infection and avoid killing the host. Parasites also need to use some host resources to reproduce and transmit infections to new hosts. Thus parasites face a tradeoÔ¨Ä between prudent exploitation and rapid reproduction-a life history tradeoÔ¨Ä between longevity and fecundity. Other tradeoÔ¨Äs among components of parasite Ô¨Åtness also inÔ¨Çuence virulence. For example, competition among parasite genotypes favors rapid growth to achieve greater relative success within the host. Rapid growth may, however, lower the total productivity of the local group by over exploiting the host, which is a potentially renewable food supply. This is a problem of kin selection and group selection. I summarize models of parasite virulence with the theoretical tools of life history analysis, kin selection, and epidemiology. I then apply the theory to recent empirical studies and models of virulence. These applications, to nematodes, to the extreme virulence of hospital epidemics, and to bacterial meningitis, show the power of simple life history theory to highlight interesting questions and to provide a rich array of hypotheses. These examples also show the kinds of conceptual mistakes that commonly arise when only a few components of parasite Ô¨Åtness are analysed in isolation. The last part of the article connects standard models of parasite virulence to diverse topics, such as the virulence of bacterial plasmids, the evolution of genomes, and the processes that inÔ¨Çuenced conÔ¨Çict and cooperation among the earliest replicators near the origin of life.},

	abstract = {There is increasing interest in the role that evolution may play in current and future pandemics, but there is often also considerable confusion about the actual evolutionary predictions. This may be, in part, due to a historical separation of evolutionary and medical fields, but there is a large, somewhat nuanced body of evidence-supported theory on the evolution of infectious disease. In this review, we synthesize this evolutionary theory in order to provide a framework for clearer understanding of the key principles. Specifically, we discuss the selection acting on zoonotic pathogens' transmission rates and virulence at spillover and during emergence. We explain how the direction and strength of selection during epidemics of emerging zoonotic disease can be understood by a three Ts framework: trade-offs, transmission, and time scales. Virulence and transmission rate may trade-off, but transmission rate is likely to be favoured by selection early in emergence, particularly if maladapted zoonotic pathogens have ‚Äòno-cost‚Äô transmission rate improving mutations available to them. Additionally, the optimal virulence and transmission rates can shift with the time scale of the epidemic. Predicting pathogen evolution, therefore, depends on understanding both the trade-offs of transmission-improving mutations and the time scales of selection.},

	abstract = {Should emerging pathogens be unusually virulent? If so, why? Existing theories of virulence evolution based on a tradeoff between high transmission rates and long infectious periods imply that epidemic growth conditions will select for higher virulence, possibly leading to a transient peak in virulence near the beginning of an epidemic. This transient selection could lead to high virulence in emerging pathogens. Using a simple model of the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of emerging pathogens, along with rough estimates of parameters for pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, West Nile virus and myxomatosis, we estimated the potential magnitude and timing of such transient virulence peaks. Pathogens that are moderately evolvable, highly transmissible, and highly virulent at equilibrium could briefly double their virulence during an epidemic; thus, epidemic-phase selection could contribute significantly to the virulence of emerging pathogens. In order to further assess the potential significance of this mechanism, we bring together data from the literature for the shapes of tradeoff curves for several pathogens (myxomatosis, HIV, and a parasite of Daphnia) and the level of genetic variation for virulence for one (myxomatosis). We discuss the need for better data on tradeoff curves and genetic variance in order to evaluate the plausibility of various scenarios of virulence evolution.},

Theory predicts that pathogens that ‚Äòkeep their host alive‚Äô can sometimes outcompete virulent pathogens in times when transmission to new susceptible hosts is unlikely. Yet, this prospect of finding a new susceptible host changes itself throughout an epidemic. In the early stage of an epidemic susceptible hosts are abundant and virulent pathogens that invest more into horizontal transmission should win the competition. Later on, the spread of the infection reduces the pool of susceptible hosts and may reverse the selection on virulence. This may favor benign pathogens after the acute phase of the epidemic. We model this transient benefit for virulence and predict both the epidemiology and the evolution of pathogens during an epidemic. To put these predictions to the test we monitor the competition of the temperate bacterial virus Œª and its virulent mutant ŒªcI857 in experimental epidemics. Our experimental results agree remarkably well with all our theoretical predictions. This demonstrates the ability of evolutionary epidemiology to predict selection for virulence in an ongoing epidemic.},

We found that parasite lines evolved in immunized mice became more virulent to both na√Øve and immune mice than lines evolved in na√Øve mice. When these evolved lines were transmitted through mosquitoes, there was a general reduction in virulence across all lines. However, the immune-selected lines remained more virulent to na√Øve mice than the na√Øve-selected lines, though not to immunized mice. Thus, immune selection accelerated the rate of virulence evolution, rendering parasites more dangerous to na√Øve hosts.

	abstract = {Marek‚Äôs disease virus (MDV), a commercially important disease of poultry, has become substantially more virulent over the last 60 years. This evolution was presumably a consequence of changes in virus ecology associated with the intensification of the poultry industry. Here, we assess whether vaccination or reduced host life span could have generated natural selection, which favored more virulent strains. Using previously published experimental data, we estimated viral fitness under a range of cohort durations and vaccine treatments on broiler farms. We found that viral fitness maximized at intermediate virulence, as a result of a trade-off between virulence and transmission previously reported. Our results suggest that vaccination, acting on this trade-off, could have led to the evolution of increased virulence. By keeping the host alive, vaccination prolongs infectious periods of virulent strains. Improvements in host genetics and nutrition, which reduced broiler life spans below 50 days, could have also increased the virulence of the circulating MDV strains because shortened cohort duration reduces the impact of host death on viral fitness. These results illustrate the dramatic impact anthropogenic change can potentially have on pathogen virulence.},

	abstract = {The recent origin and great evolutionary potential of HIV imply that the virulence of the virus might still be changing, which could greatly affect the future of the pandemic. However, previous studies of time trends of HIV virulence have yielded conflicting results. Here we used an established methodology to assess time trends in the severity (virulence) of untreated HIV infections in a large Italian cohort. We characterized clinical virulence by the decline slope of the CD4 count (n = 1423 patients) and the viral setpoint (n = 785 patients) in untreated patients with sufficient data points. We used linear regression models to detect correlations between the date of diagnosis (ranging 1984‚Äì2006) and the virulence markers, controlling for gender, exposure category, age, and CD4 count at entry. The decline slope of the CD4 count and the viral setpoint displayed highly significant correlation with the date of diagnosis pointing in the direction of increasing virulence. A detailed analysis of riskgroups revealed that the epidemics of intravenous drug users started with an apparently less virulent virus, but experienced the strongest trend towards steeper CD4 decline among the major exposure categories. While our study did not allow us to exclude the effect of potential time trends in host factors, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis of increasing HIV virulence. Importantly, the use of an established methodology allowed for a comparison with earlier results, which confirmed that genuine differences exist in the time trends of HIV virulence between different epidemics. We thus conclude that there is not a single global trend of HIV virulence, and results obtained in one epidemic cannot be extrapolated to others. Comparison of discordant patterns between riskgroups and epidemics hints at a converging trend, which might indicate that an optimal level of virulence might exist for the virus.},

	abstract = {There are global increases in the use of HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART), guided by clinical benefits of early ART initiation and the efficacy of treatment as prevention of transmission. Separately, it has been shown theoretically and empirically that HIV virulence can evolve over time; observed virulence levels may reflect an adaptive balance between infected lifespan and per-contact transmission rate. However, the potential effects of widespread ART usage on HIV virulence are unknown. To predict these effects, we used an agent-based stochastic model to simulate evolutionary trends in HIV virulence, using set point viral load as a proxy for virulence. We calibrated our model to prevalence and incidence trends of South Africa. We explored two distinct ART scenarios: (1) ART initiation based on HIV-infected individuals reaching a CD4 count threshold; and (2) ART initiation based on individual time elapsed since HIV infection (a scenario that mimics ‚Äúuniversal testing and treatment‚Äù (UTT) aspirations). In each case, we considered a range in population uptake of ART. We found that HIV virulence is generally unchanged in scenarios of CD4-based initiation. However, with ART initiation based on time since infection, virulence can increase moderately within several years of ART rollout, under high coverage levels and early treatment initiation (albeit within the context of epidemics that are rapidly decreasing in size). Sensitivity analyses suggested the impact of ART on virulence is relatively insensitive to model calibration. Our modeling study suggests that increasing HIV virulence driven by UTT is likely not a major public health concern, but should be monitored in sentinel surveillance, in a manner similar to transmitted resistance to antiretroviral drugs.},

	abstract = {Objective
The potential for changing HIV-1 virulence has significant implications for the AIDS epidemic, including changing HIV transmission rates, rapidity of disease progression, and timing of ART. Published data to date have provided conflicting results.

Design
We conducted a meta-analysis of changes in baseline CD4+ T-cell counts and set point plasma viral RNA load over time in order to establish whether summary trends are consistent with changing HIV-1 virulence.

Methods
We searched PubMed for studies of trends in HIV-1 prognostic markers of disease progression and supplemented findings with publications referenced in epidemiological or virulence studies. We identified 12 studies of trends in baseline CD4+ T-cell counts (21 052 total individuals), and eight studies of trends in set point viral loads (10 785 total individuals), spanning the years 1984‚Äì2010. Using random-effects meta-analysis, we estimated summary effect sizes for trends in HIV-1 plasma viral loads and CD4+ T-cell counts.

Results
Baseline CD4+ T-cell counts showed a summary trend of decreasing cell counts [effect=‚àí4.93 cells/¬µl per year, 95\% confidence interval (CI) ‚àí6.53 to ‚àí3.3]. Set point viral loads showed a summary trend of increasing plasma viral RNA loads (effect=0.013 log10 copies/ml per year, 95\% CI ‚àí0.001 to 0.03). The trend rates decelerated in recent years for both prognostic markers.

Conclusion
Our results are consistent with increased virulence of HIV-1 over the course of the epidemic. Extrapolating over the 30 years since the first description of AIDS, this represents a CD4+ T cells loss of approximately 148 cells/¬µl and a gain of 0.39 log10 copies/ml of viral RNA measured during early infection. These effect sizes would predict increasing rates of disease progression, and need for ART as well as increasing transmission risk.},

One important aspect of a pathogen‚Äôs environment is the probability that an infectious contact (a sneeze for a respiratory disease, or an unprotected sex act for a sexually transmitted disease) encounters an uninfected person and thus has a chance to transmit the pathogen. As an epidemic grows the number of uninfected people shrinks, changing evolutionary pressures on the pathogen. While researchers have used models to explore pathogen evolution during epidemics, their models usually neglect important processes such as people entering and leaving sexual partnerships. We compared several evolutionary models for HIV that include partnership dynamics as well as sexual contact outside of stable partnerships. Models of intermediate complexity predicted lower virulence midway through the epidemic (a minimum of 15 years to progress to AIDS) than either more realistic models or simple models with no partnership structure (both with a minimum of 7.25 years to progress to AIDS), because random sexual contacts tended to wash out the effects of stable partnerships. Researchers trying to predict the evolution of pathogens must try to understand the implications of their modeling choices; models of intermediate complexity may not produce intermediate conclusions.},

However, the defense systems in both pathogens and their hosts are complex and the degree of genetic variation in resistance and tolerance will depend on the trade-offs that they impose on host fitness as well as their life-histories. The genes and pathways underpinning resistance and tolerance traits may be distinct or intertwined as the outcome of any infection is a result of a balance between collateral damage of host tissues and control of the invading pathogen. Genes and molecular pathways associated with resistance are mainly expressed in the mucosal tract and the innate immune system and control the very early events following pathogen invasion. Resistance genes encode receptors involved in uptake of pathogens, as well as pattern recognition receptors (PRR) such as the toll-like receptor family as well as molecules involved in strong and rapid inflammatory responses which lead to rapid pathogen clearance, yet do not lead to immunopathology. In contrast tolerance genes and pathways play a role in reducing immunopathology or enhancing the host's ability to protect against pathogen associated toxins. Candidate tolerance genes may include cytosolic PRRs and unidentified sensors of pathogen growth, perturbation of host metabolism and intrinsic danger or damage associated molecules. In addition, genes controlling regulatory pathways, tissue repair and resolution are also tolerance candidates. The identities of distinct genetic loci for resistance and tolerance to infectious pathogens in livestock species remain to be determined. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved and phenotypes associated with resistance and tolerance should ultimately help to improve livestock health and welfare.},

Although hypotheses exist that emphasize the role of evolutionary history (e.g., enemy release hypothesis \& defense-free space hypothesis), predicting the impact of non-native herbivorous insects has eluded scientists for over a century. Using a census of all 58 non-native conifer-specialist insects in North America, we quantified the contribution of over 25 factors that could affect the impact they have on their novel hosts, including insect traits (fecundity, voltinism, native range, etc.), host traits (shade tolerance, growth rate, wood density, etc.), and evolutionary relationships (between native and novel hosts and insects). We discovered that divergence times between native and novel hosts, the shade and drought tolerance of the novel host, and the presence of a coevolved congener on a shared host, were more predictive of impact than the traits of the invading insect. These factors built upon each other to strengthen our ability to predict the risk of a non-native insect becoming invasive. This research is the first to empirically support historically assumed hypotheses about the importance of evolutionary history as a major driver of impact of non-native herbivorous insects. Our novel, integrated model predicts whether a non-native insect not yet present in North America will have a one in 6.5 to a one in 2,858 chance of causing widespread mortality of a conifer species if established (R2 = 0.91) Synthesis and applications. With this advancement, the risk to other conifer host species and regions can be assessed, and regulatory and pest management efforts can be more efficiently prioritized.},

The overall level of defence of a host individual or population includes mechanisms that reduce parasite exposure (avoidance), establishment (resistance) or pathogenicity (tolerance). However, how these traits operate and evolve in concert is not well understood. Here, we investigated genetic variation in and associations between avoidance, resistance and tolerance in a natural host‚Äìparasite system. Replicated populations of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and sea trout (an anadromous form of brown trout, Salmo trutta) were raised under common garden conditions and infected with the eye fluke Diplostomum pseudospathaceum. We demonstrate significant genetic variation in the defence traits across host populations and negative associations between the traits, with the most resistant populations showing the weakest avoidance and the lowest infection tolerance. These results are suggestive of trade-offs between different components of defence and possibly underlie the genetic variation in defence traits observed in the wild. Because the three defence mechanisms affect host‚Äìparasite evolution in profoundly different ways, we emphasize the importance of studying these traits in concert.},

Here, we investigated (1) whether one easy-to-measure form of tolerance described well the dynamic relationships between host health and parasite burden, and (2) whether individual resistance and tolerance to West Nile virus (WNV) were predictable from single cytokine measures. We exposed house sparrows (HOSP) to WNV and measured subsequent changes in host performance, viral burden, and cytokine expression. We then used two novel approaches (one complex, one simpler) to estimate tolerance within-individual HOSP using four separate host performance traits. We lastly investigated changes in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-Œ≥ (IFN-Œ≥) and anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10). Both approaches to estimating tolerance were equivalent among WNV-infected HOSP; thus, an easy-to-measure tolerance estimation may be successfully applied in field studies. Constitutive expression of IFN-Œ≥ and IL-10 were predictive of resistance and tolerance to WNV, implicating these cytokines as viable biomarkers of host competence to WNV.},

Since MHC molecules play an important role in the induction of immune responses, the evolution of MHC polymorphism is often explained in terms of increased protection of hosts against pathogens. Two selective pressures that are thought to be involved are (1) selection favoring MHC heterozygous hosts, and (2) selection for rare MHC alleles by host-pathogen coevolution. We have developed a computer simulation of coevolving hosts and pathogens to study the relative impact of these two mechanisms on the evolution of MHC polymorphism. We found that heterozygote advantage per se is insuÔ¨Äicient to explain the high degree of polymorphism at the MHC, even in very large host populations. Host-pathogen coevolution, on the other hand, can easily account for realistic polymorphisms of more than 50 alleles per MHC locus. Since evolving pathogens mainly evade presentation by the most common MHC alleles in the host population, they provide a selective pressure for a large variety of rare MHC alleles. Provided that the host population is suÔ¨Äiciently large, a large set of MHC alleles can persist over many host generations under host-pathogen coevolution, despite the fact that allele frequencies continuously change.},

However, establishing the relative importance of the three proposed mechanisms of PMS (heterozygote advantage, rare-allele advantage and fluctuating selection) has proved extremely difficult. Studies have attempted to differentiate between mechanisms of PMS using two approaches: (i) comparing MHC diversity with that expected under neutrality and (ii) relating MHC diversity to pathogen regime. Here, we show that in many cases the same predictions arise from the different mechanisms under these approaches, and that most studies that have inferred one mechanism of selection have not fully considered the alternative explanations. We argue that, while it may be possible to demonstrate that particular mechanisms of PMS are occurring, resolving their relative importance within a system is probably impossible. A more realistic target is to continue to demonstrate when and where the different mechanisms of PMS occur, with the aim of determining their relative importance across systems. We put forward what we believe to be the most promising approaches that will allow us to progress towards achieving this.},

This distinction is useful because it recognizes that hosts that are best at controlling parasite burdens are not necessarily the healthiest.

Sensitivity analysis for parasite fitness and life-history theory shows promise to generate a more general evolutionary theory of virulence by including a major element, immune evasion to prevent parasite clearance from the host. Also, the study of dose‚Äìresponse relationships and multiple infections should be particularly illuminating to understand the evolution of virulence. Taking into account immune evasion brings immunological processes to the core of understanding the evolution of parasite virulence and for a range of related issues such as dose, host specificity or immunopathology.

To investigate the genetic history of this mutation in the {AJ} population, a conserved haplotype (D15S981:175‚ÄìD15S131:240‚ÄìD15S1050:284‚ÄìD15S197:144‚ÄìD15S188:418) was identified in 1278insTATC chromosomes from 55 unrelated {AJ} individuals (15 homozygotes and 40 heterozygotes for the {TSD} mutation), suggesting the occurrence of a common founder. When two methods were used for analysis of linkage disequilibrium ({LD}) between flanking polymorphic markers and the disease locus and for the study of the decay of {LD} over time, the estimated age of the insertion was found to be 40¬±12 generations (95\% confidence interval: 30‚Äì50 generations), so that the most recent common ancestor of the mutation-bearing chromosomes would date to the 8th‚Äì9th century. This corresponds with the demographic expansion of {AJs} in central Europe, following the founding of the Ashkenaz settlement in the early Middle Ages. The results are consistent with the geographic distribution of the main {TSD} mutation, 1278insTATC being more common in central Europe, and with the coalescent times of mutations causing two other {LSDs}, Gaucher disease and mucolipidosis type {IV}. Evidence for the absence of a determinant positive selection (heterozygote advantage) over the mutation is provided by a comparison between the estimated age of 1278insTATC and the probability of the current {AJ} frequency of the mutant allele as a function of its age, calculated by use of a branching-process model. Therefore, the founder effect in a rapidly expanding population arising from a bottleneck provides a robust parsimonious hypothesis explaining the spread of 1278insTATC-linked {TSD} in {AJ} individuals.},

	doi = {10.1093/molbev/msg162},
	abstract = {Malaria parasites (Plasmodium falciparum) provide an excellent system in which to study the genomic effects of strong selection in a recombining eukaryote because the rapid spread of resistance to multiple drugs during the last the past 50 years has been well documented, the full genome sequence and a microsatellite map are now available, and haplotype data can be easily generated. We examined microsatellite variation around the dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) gene on chromosome 4 of P. falciparum. Point mutations in dhfr are known to be responsible for resistance to the antimalarial drug pyrimethamine, and resistance to this drug has spread rapidly in Southeast ({SE}) Asia after its introduction in 1970s. We genotyped 33 microsatellite markers distributed across chromosome 4 in 61 parasites from a location on the Thailand/Myanmar border. We observed minimal microsatellite length variation in a 12-kb (0.7-{cM}) region flanking the dhfr gene and diminished variation for approximately 100 kb (6 {cM}), indicative of a single origin of resistant alleles. Furthermore, we found the same or similar microsatellite haplotypes flanked resistant dhfr alleles sampled from 11 parasite populations in five {SE} Asian countries indicating recent invasion of a single lineage of resistant dhfr alleles in locations 2,000 km apart. Three features of these data are of especial interest. (1) Pyrimethamine resistance is generally assumed to have evolved multiple times because the genetic basis is simple and resistance can be selected easily in the laboratory. Yet our data clearly indicate a single origin of resistant dhfr alleles sampled over a large region of {SE} Asia. (2) The wide valley (‚àº6 {cM}) of reduced variation around dhfr provides ‚Äúproof-of-principle‚Äù that genome-wide association may be an effective way to locate genes under strong recent selection. (3) The width of the selective valley is consistent with predictions based on independent measures of recombination, mutation, and selection intensity, suggesting that we have reasonable estimates of these parameters. We conclude that scanning the malaria parasite genome for evidence of recent selection may prove an extremely effective way to locate genes underlying recently evolved traits such as drug resistance, as well as providing an opportunity to study the dynamics of selective events that have occurred recently or are currently in progress.},

The great diversity of these antigen-binding molecules confers differential advantages in responding to pathogens, but presents a major obstacle to distinguishing HLA allele‚Äìspecific effects. HLA class I supertypes provide a functional classification for the many different HLA alleles that overlap in their peptide-binding specificities. We analyzed the association of these discrete HLA supertypes with HIV disease progression rates in a population of HIV-infected men. We found that HLA supertypes alone and in combination conferred a strong differential advantage in responding to HIV infection, independent of the contribution of single HLA alleles that associate with progression of the disease. The correlation of the frequency of the HLA supertypes with viral load suggests that HIV adapts to the most frequent alleles in the population, providing a selective advantage for those individuals who express rare alleles.},

	abstract = {An HIV-1 infection progresses in most human individuals sooner or later into AIDS, a devastating disease that kills more than a million people worldwide on an annual basis. Nonetheless, certain HIV-1-infected persons appear to act as long-term non-progressors, and elite control is associated with the presence of particular MHC class I allotypes such as HLA-B*27 or -B*57. The HIV-1 pandemic in humans arose from the cross-species transmission of SIVcpz originating from chimpanzees. Chimpanzees, however, appear to be relatively resistant to developing AIDS after HIV-1/SIVcpz infection. Mounting evidence illustrates that, in the distant past, chimpanzees experienced a selective sweep resulting in a severe reduction of their MHC class I repertoire. This was most likely caused by an HIV-1/SIV-like retrovirus, suggesting that chimpanzees may have experienced long-lasting host-virus relationships with SIV-like viruses. Hence, if natural selection is allowed to follow its course, prospects for the human population may look grim, thus underscoring the desperate need for an effective vaccine.},

	abstract = {The CCR5 chemokine receptor is exploited by HIV-1 to gain entry into CD4+ T cells. A deletion mutation (Œî32) confers resistance against HIV by obliterating the expression of the receptor on the cell surface. Intriguingly, this allele is young in evolutionary time, yet it has reached relatively high frequencies in Europe. These properties indicate that the mutation has been under intense positive selection. HIV-1 has not exerted selection for long enough on the human population to drive the CCR5-Œî32 allele to current frequencies, fueling debate regarding the selective pressure responsible for rise of the allele. The allele exists at appreciable frequencies only in Europe, and within Europe, the frequency is higher in the north. Here we review the population genetics of the CCR5 locus, the debate over the historical selective pressure acting on CCR5-Œî32, the inferences that can potentially be drawn from the geographic distribution of CCR5-Œî32 and the role that other genetic polymorphisms play in conferring resistance against HIV. We also discuss parallel evolution that has occurred at the CCR5 locus of other primate species. Finally, we highlight the promise that therapies based on interfering with the CCR5 receptor could have in the treatment of HIV.},

We estimated that globally 0.45 million individuals have PKU, with global prevalence 1:23,930 live births (range 1:4,500 [Italy]‚Äì1:125,000 [Japan]). Comparing genotypes and metabolic phenotypes from 16,092 affected subjects revealed differences in disease severity in 51 countries from 17 world regions, with the global phenotype distribution of 62\% classic PKU, 22\% mild PKU, and 16\% mild hyperphenylalaninemia. A gradient in genotype and phenotype distribution exists across Europe, from classic PKU in the east to mild PKU in the southwest and mild hyperphenylalaninemia in the south. The c.1241A{\textgreater}G (p.Tyr414Cys)-associated genotype can be traced from Northern to Western Europe, from Sweden via Norway, to Denmark, to the Netherlands. The frequency of classic PKU increases from Europe (56\%) via Middle East (71\%) to Australia (80\%). Of 758 PAH variants, c.1222C{\textgreater}T (p.Arg408Trp) (22.2\%), c.1066‚àí11G{\textgreater}A (IVS10‚àí11G{\textgreater}A) (6.4\%), and c.782G{\textgreater}A (p.Arg261Gln) (5.5\%) were most common and responsible for two prevalent genotypes: p.[Arg408Trp];[Arg408Trp] (11.4\%) and c.[1066‚àí11G{\textgreater}A];[1066‚àí11G{\textgreater}A] (2.6\%). Most genotypes (73\%) were compound heterozygous, 27\% were homozygous, and 55\% of 3,659 different genotypes occurred in only a single individual. PAH variants were scored using an allelic phenotype value and correlated with pre-treatment blood phenylalanine concentrations (n = 6,115) and tetrahydrobiopterin loading test results (n = 4,381), enabling prediction of both a genotype-based phenotype (88\%) and tetrahydrobiopterin responsiveness (83\%).

We outline how interspecies interactions can affect the responses of individual species and communities to antibiotic treatment, and how these responses could affect the strength of selection, potentially changing the trajectory of resistance evolution. Finally, we identify key areas of future research which will allow for a more complete understanding of antibiotic resistance in bacterial communities. We emphasise that acknowledging the ecological context, i.e. the interactions that occur between pathogens and within communities, could help the development of more efficient and effective antibiotic treatments.},

Academic institutions should be well positioned to lead the early stages of these efforts given their many thousands of locations globally and because they are not constrained by the same commercial considerations as industry. University groups can lack the full complement of knowledge and skills needed though (eg. how to tailor screening strategy to biological source material). In this article, we review three key aspects of the bioprospecting literature (source material and in vitro antibacterial and toxicity testing) and present an integrated multidisciplinary perspective on (a) source material selection, (b) legal, taxonomic and other issues related to source material, (c) cultivation methods, (d) bioassay selection, (e) technical standards available, (f) extract/compound dissolution, (g) use of minimum inhibitory concentration and selectivity index values to identify progressible extracts and compounds, and (h) avoidable pitfalls. The review closes with recommendations for future study design and information on subsequent steps in the bioprospecting process.},

The discovery and development of the penicillin-type and cephalosporin-type Œ≤-lactams and their synthetic versions were transformative in emergence of the modern pharmaceutical industry. They remain some of the most important antibiotics, even 70 years after their discovery. Meanwhile, thousands of fungal metabolites have been discovered, yet these metabolites have only contributed a few additional compounds that have entered clinical development. Substantial expansion in fungal biodiversity assessment along with the availability of modern ‚Äú-OMICS‚Äù technology and revolutionary developments in fungal biotechnology have been made in the last 15 years subsequent to the exit of most of the big Pharma companies from the field of novel antibiotics discovery. Therefore, the timing seems opportune to revisit these fascinating chemically rich organisms as a reservoir of small-molecule templates for lead discovery. This review will describe ongoing interdisciplinary scenarios in which specialists in fungal biology collaborate with chemists, pharmacologists and biochemical and process engineers in order to reveal and make new antibiotics. The utility of a pre-selection process based on phylogenetic data and distribution of secondary metabolite encoding gene cluster will be highlighted. Examples of novel bioactive metabolites from fungi derived from special ecological groups and new phylogenetic lineages will also be discussed.},

This is true, but the real wonder is the rise of antibiotic resistance in hospitals, communities, and the environment concomitant with their use. The extraordinary genetic capacities of microbes have benefitted from man's overuse of antibiotics to exploit every source of resistance genes and every means of horizontal gene transmission to develop multiple mechanisms of resistance for each and every antibiotic introduced into practice clinically, agriculturally, or otherwise. This review presents the salient aspects of antibiotic resistance development over the past half-century, with the oft-restated conclusion that it is time to act. To achieve complete restitution of therapeutic applications of antibiotics, there is a need for more information on the role of environmental microbiomes in the rise of antibiotic resistance. In particular, creative approaches to the discovery of novel antibiotics and their expedited and controlled introduction to therapy are obligatory.},

Many antibiotics that were formerly effective in combating bacterial infections in hospital patients are no longer effective because of the evolution of resistant strains, which compromises medical care worldwide.

At the bacteria level, patients infected with these strains generate both nonresistant and resistant bacteria. At the patient level, susceptible patients are infected by infected patients at rates proportional to the total bacteria load of each strain present in the hospital. The objectives of this paper are to analyze the dynamic elements of nonresistant and resistant bacteria strains in epidemic populations in hospital environments and to provide understanding of measures to avoid the endemicity of resistant antibiotic strains.},

defective mutants. This high mutation frequency could explain why
resistance is so frequently acquired during antibiotic treatment of
infections. Inactivation of the
gene had no substantial effect on the mutation
frequency, suggesting that MutS-dependent mismatch repair is absent in
this bacterium. Furthermore, clarithromycin resistance conferred a
biological cost, as measured by a decreased competitive ability of the
resistant mutants in mice. In clinical isolates this cost could be
reduced, indicating that compensation is a clinically relevant
phenomenon that could act to stabilize resistant bacteria in a

However, bacteria have been able to evolve to become antibiotic resistant. Nowadays, a proÔ¨Åcient pathogen must be virulent, epidemic, and resistant to antibiotics. Analysis of the interplay among these features of bacterial populations is needed to predict the future of infectious diseases. In this regard, we have reviewed the genetic linkage of antibiotic resistance and bacterial virulence in the same genetic determinants as well as the cross talk between antibiotic resistance and virulence regulatory circuits with the aim of understanding the eÔ¨Äect of acquisition of resistance on bacterial virulence. We also discuss the possibility that antibiotic resistance and bacterial virulence might prevail as linked phenotypes in the future. The novel situation brought about by the worldwide use of antibiotics is undoubtedly changing bacterial populations. These changes might alter the properties of not only bacterial pathogens, but also the normal host microbiota. The evolutionary consequences of the release of antibiotics into the environment are largely unknown, but most probably restoration of the microbiota from the preantibiotic era is beyond our current abilities.},

	abstract = {Phage therapy is the use of bacterial viruses (bacteriophage) to treat bacterial infections. It has been practiced sporadically on humans and domestic animals for nearly 75 yr. Nevertheless, phage therapy has remained outside the mainstream of modern medicine, presumably because of doubts about its eÔ¨Äicacy, and possibly because it was eclipsed by antibiotics and other chemotherapeutic agents. In this report, we develop the study of phage therapy and antibiotic therapy as a population biological phenomenon-the dynamic interaction of bacteria with a predator (phage) or a toxic chemical (antibiotic) inside a host whose immune and other defenses also aÔ¨Äect the interaction. Our goal is to identify the conditions under which phage and antibiotics can successfully control a bacterial infection and when they cannot. We review data published in the 1980s by H. Williams Smith and J. B. Huggins on the use of phage and antibiotics to control lethal, systemic infections of Escherichia coli in experimentally inoculated mice. We show that some of their observations can be accommodated by a quantitative model that invokes known or plausible assumptions about host defenses and the interactions of bacteria with phage and antibiotics; some observations remain unexplained by the model. Our analysis identiÔ¨Åes several hypotheses about the population dynamics of phage and antibiotic therapy that can be tested experimentally. Included among these are hypotheses that account for variation in the eÔ¨Äicacy of the diÔ¨Äerent phages employed by Smith and Huggins and why, in their study, phages were more eÔ¨Äective than antibiotics.},

In the colicin version of the RPS model, strains that produce colicins (C) kill sensitive (S) strains, which outcompete resistant (R) strains, which outcompete C strains. Pairwise in vitro competitions between these three strains are resolved in a predictable order (C beats S, S beats R, and R beats C), but the complete system of three strains presents the opportunity for dynamic equilibrium.

	abstract = {Objective To systematically review the literature and, where appropriate, meta-analyse studies investigating subsequent antibiotic resistance in individuals prescribed antibiotics in primary care.
Design Systematic review with meta-analysis.
Data sources Observational and experimental studies identified through Medline, Embase, and Cochrane searches.
Review methods Electronic searches using MeSH terms and text words identified 4373 papers. Two independent reviewers assessed quality of eligible studies and extracted data. Meta-analyses were conducted for studies presenting similar outcomes.
Results The review included 24 studies; 22 involved patients with symptomatic infection and two involved healthy volunteers; 19 were observational studies (of which two were prospective) and five were randomised trials. In five studies of urinary tract bacteria (14 348 participants), the pooled odds ratio (OR) for resistance was 2.5 (95\% confidence interval 2.1 to 2.9) within 2 months of antibiotic treatment and 1.33 (1.2 to 1.5) within 12 months. In seven studies of respiratory tract bacteria (2605 participants), pooled ORs were 2.4 (1.4 to 3.9) and 2.4 (1.3 to 4.5) for the same periods, respectively. Studies reporting the quantity of antibiotic prescribed found that longer duration and multiple courses were associated with higher rates of resistance. Studies comparing the potential for different antibiotics to induce resistance showed no consistent effects. Only one prospective study reported changes in resistance over a long period; pooled ORs fell from 12.2 (6.8 to 22.1) at 1 week to 6.1 (2.8 to 13.4) at 1 month, 3.6 (2.2 to 6.0) at 2 months, and 2.2 (1.3 to 3.6) at 6 months.
Conclusions Individuals prescribed an antibiotic in primary care for a respiratory or urinary infection develop bacterial resistance to that antibiotic. The effect is greatest in the month immediately after treatment but may persist for up to 12 months. This effect not only increases the population carriage of organisms resistant to first line antibiotics, but also creates the conditions for increased use of second line antibiotics in the community.},

	abstract = {Since the introduction of antibiotics as therapeutic agents, many bacterial pathogens have developed resistance to antibiotics. Mobile resistance genes, acquired through horizontal gene transfer, play an important role in this process. Understanding from which bacterial taxa these genes were mobilized, and whether their origin taxa share common traits, is critical for predicting which environments and conditions contribute to the emergence of novel resistance genes. This knowledge may prove valuable for limiting or delaying future transfer of novel resistance genes into pathogens. The literature on the origins of mobile resistance genes is scattered and based on evidence of variable quality. Here, we summarize, amend and scrutinize the evidence for 37 proposed origins of mobile resistance genes. Using state-of-the-art genomic analyses, we supplement and evaluate the evidence based on well-defined criteria. Nineteen percent of reported origins did not fulfill the criteria to confidently assign the respective origin. Of the curated origin taxa, {\textgreater}90\% have been associated with infection in humans or domestic animals, some taxa being the origin of several different resistance genes. The clinical emergence of these resistance genes appears to be a consequence of antibiotic selection pressure on taxa that are permanently or transiently associated with the human/domestic animal microbiome.},

AAU for animal growth promotion or for treatment or control of animal diseases generates reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant (AR) bacteria that contaminate animal food products. Mathematical models are an important tool for understanding the potential medical consequences of this increased exposure. We have developed a mathematical model to evaluate factors affecting the prevalence of human commensal AR bacteria that cause opportunistic infections (e.g., enterococci). Our analysis suggests that AAU hastens the appearance of AR bacteria in humans. Our model indicates that the greatest impact occurs very early in the emergence of resistance, when AR bacteria are rare, possibly below the detection limits of current surveillance methods.},

Although mutant RT also unblocked ddAMP-terminated primers more efficiently than wild-type RT, the removal of ddAMP was effectively inhibited by the next complementary dNTP (IC50 ‚âà 12 ŒºM).

Data were collected by the provincial Public Health Laboratories-Toronto, Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, which performed almost all serotyping on invasive (blood, CSF, other sterile sites) H. influenzae strains isolated in the province during the study period. Temporal trends for Hib, other typeable strains, and non-typeable H. influenzae were evaluated by Poisson regression, controlling for the specimen submissions. Prior to infant Hib vaccination, the most commonly observed serotype was serotype b (64.9\%). Subsequently, 70.3\%, 13.6\%, and 9.4\% of isolates were non-typeable, serotype f, and serotype b, respectively. Infant Hib vaccination resulted in a decrease in Hib incidence in all age groups (pooled IRR 0.432) and marked increases of non-typeable and serotype f H. influenzae in children aged \&lt;5 years (IRR 2.4 and 3.0, respectively). Vaccination against Hib has altered the epidemiology of invasive H. influenzae infections in Ontario. Prevention of invasive Hib disease was observed in both vaccinated and unvaccinated age groups. Invasive H. influenzae infection now commonly presents as sepsis due to non-typeable H. influenzae in older individuals. However, strain replacement of Hib with serotype f and non-typeable strains in children under 5 years was documented.},

	abstract = {Bordetella pertussis is the causative agent of pertussis, a highly contagious disease of the human respiratory tract. Despite high vaccination coverage, pertussis has resurged and has become one of the most prevalent vaccine-preventable diseases in developed countries. We have proposed that both waning immunity and pathogen adaptation have contributed to the persistence and resurgence of pertussis. Allelic variation has been found in virulence-associated genes coding for the pertussis toxin A subunit (ptxA), pertactin (prn), serotype 2 fimbriae (fim2), serotype 3 fimbriae (fim3) and the promoter for pertussis toxin (ptxP). In this study, we investigated how more than 60 years of vaccination has affected the Dutch B. pertussis population by combining data from phylogeny, genomics and temporal trends in strain frequencies. Our main focus was on the ptxA, prn, fim3 and ptxP genes. However, we also compared the genomes of 11 Dutch strains belonging to successful lineages. Our results showed that, between 1949 and 2010, the Dutch B. pertussis population has undergone as least four selective sweeps that were associated with small mutations in ptxA, prn, fim3 and ptxP. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a stepwise adaptation in which mutations accumulated clonally. Genomic analysis revealed a number of additional mutations which may have a contributed to the selective sweeps. Five large deletions were identified which were fixed in the pathogen population. However, only one was linked to a selective sweep. No evidence was found for a role of gene acquisition in pathogen adaptation. Our results suggest that the B. pertussis gene repertoire is already well adapted to its current niche and required only fine tuning to persist in the face of vaccination. Further, this work shows that small mutations, even single SNPs, can drive large changes in the populations of bacterial pathogens within a time span of six to 19 years.},

	abstract = {Quinine remains an important anti-malarial drug almost 400 years after its effectiveness was first documented. However, its continued use is challenged by its poor tolerability, poor compliance with complex dosing regimens, and the availability of more efficacious anti-malarial drugs. This article reviews the historical role of quinine, considers its current usage and provides insight into its appropriate future use in the treatment of malaria. In light of recent research findings intravenous artesunate should be the first-line drug for severe malaria, with quinine as an alternative. The role of rectal quinine as pre-referral treatment for severe malaria has not been fully explored, but it remains a promising intervention. In pregnancy, quinine continues to play a critical role in the management of malaria, especially in the first trimester, and it will remain a mainstay of treatment until safer alternatives become available. For uncomplicated malaria, artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) offers a better option than quinine though the difficulty of maintaining a steady supply of ACT in resource-limited settings renders the rapid withdrawal of quinine for uncomplicated malaria cases risky. The best approach would be to identify solutions to ACT stock-outs, maintain quinine in case of ACT stock-outs, and evaluate strategies for improving quinine treatment outcomes by combining it with antibiotics. In HIV and TB infected populations, concerns about potential interactions between quinine and antiretroviral and anti-tuberculosis drugs exist, and these will need further research and pharmacovigilance.},

Here we show positive relationships between testosterone, facial attractiveness and immune function (antibody response to a hepatitis B vaccine) in human males, and present some preliminary evidence that these relationships are moderated by naturally co-occurring cortisol (a glucocorticoid stress hormone involved in the fight-or-flight response). We conclude that our results provide support for a role of glucocorticoids in hormonally mediated sexual selection.},

According to ICHH only high-quality individuals can maintain high levels of testosterone and afford the physiological cost of hormone-derived immunosuppression. The animal and human studies that attempted to support the ICHH by precisely defined impairment of immunity associated with high testosterone levels are inconclusive. Furthermore, human studies have used only selected immune functions and varying testosterone fractions. This is the first study examining the relationship between multiple innate and adaptive immunity and serum levels of free testosterone, total testosterone, DHT and DHEA in ninety-seven healthy men. Free testosterone and marginally DHT levels were positively correlated with the strength of the influenza post-vaccination response. Total testosterone and DHEA showed no immunomodulatory properties. Our findings did not support ICHH assumptions about immunosuppressive function of androgens. In the affluent society studied here, men with higher levels of free testosterone could afford to invest more in adaptive immunity. Since the hormone-immune relationship is complex and may depend on multiple factors, including access to food resources, androgens should be treated as immunomodulators rather than implicit immunosuppressants.},

We found several indications of an immunocompetence handicap in our study: females had superior immunocompetence compared with males, the different immune traits were positively correlated, and there were indications of genetic variation in immune traits. However, we found no significant difference in the immunocompetence of offspring derived from males differing in ornament expression, only a tendency for sons of ornamented males to possess slightly better immunocompetence. The estimated effect of fathers on offspring immunocompetence was rather small, but it might be a sufficient benefit of female choice, provided that the costs of choice are small. We conclude that the genetic benefit of female choice is small concerning offspring immunocompetence, but the immunocompetence handicap principle might nevertheless work in scorpionflies.},

We explored the proximate pathways of T‚Äêinduced immunosuppression in song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) by treating captive nonbreeding males with different androgens and measuring several components of acquired immune function. Males implanted with T suppressed cell‚Äêmediated and humoral immune responses compared to males implanted with 5‚àù‚Äêdihydrotestosterone (DHT), dehydroepiandrosterone, or control (empty) implants. Furthermore, T treatment increased plasma levels of corticosterone and decreased body mass and fat stores in relation to other treatments.

Instead, we outline indirect pathways that are likely responsible for suppression of the avian immune system that include stress‚Äêinduced immunosuppression, aromatization to estrogen, and alterations in energy allocation that constrain expenditures toward immune system activation.},

In support of this, C has been shown to mediate and moderate relationships between T and immune response and to be inversely related to attractiveness in some avian species. We predicted that female preferences for cues to T in human male faces would be contingent upon co-occurring cortisol levels. In study 1, we tested relationships between T and cortisol and attractiveness, masculinity and health ratings of raw male faces. We found cortisol to be inversely related to attractiveness. In study 2, we tested female preferences for male faces that were parametrically manipulated on the basis of cues to naturally co-occurring levels of T and cortisol across the menstrual cycle. Women preferred cues to low cortisol in general and in the fertile phase of the cycle, and there was an interaction between T and cortisol in general and in the non-fertile phase. Results were consistent with the SL-ICHH but not the original immunocompetence handicap model: females expressed preferences for cues to cortisol but not for cues to T, except in interaction with the stress hormone. Results inform the SL-ICHH by demonstrating female preferences for low cortisol and the nature of its interaction with T in humans, as well as indicating the traits that may be signalled by different combinations of the hormones including immune response, current health and resource acquisition characteristics.},

We present results of an experiment using males of the sexually dimorphic house sparrow (Passer domesticus), that support the idea that the male-specific bib can be both a handicap-revealing signal and a reliable badge indicating the physical condition of the bird. In a test of the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis, wild-caught adult male house sparrows were studied in captivity. Birds implanted with elevated doses of testosterone were more dominant, had higher circulating levels of both testosterone and corticosterone and they also harboured relatively larger ectoparasite loads. Higher parasite loads were also associated with individuals showing lower immunocompetence and larger changes in bib size. A new model for immunocompetence effects in sexual selection is introduced, integrating actions that the hypothalamopituitary axis exerts on gonads, adrenals and the thyroid gland.

A key aspect of this hypothesis is that testosterone (T) has a bimodal effect: a higher T level enhances the expression of ornaments (increasing mating success and, ultimately, fitness); however, at the same time, it suppresses immune function. Tests of the latter assumption, which have focused mainly on aspects of adaptive immunity in birds, led to equivocal results. We performed a hormone‚Äêimplant experiment in male three‚Äêspined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) to test the key assumptions of the ICHH in a fish, where the dominant circulating androgen is 11‚Äêketotestosterone (11kT) rather than T. Males were implanted with 11‚Äêketoandrostenedione, which is a natural precursor of 11kT. Each individual‚Äôs circulating 11kT level, ornamentation, and immunocompetence were measured 2 weeks later. In addition, we quantified oxidative tissue damage because the ICHH has been hypothesized to work via oxidative stress. We found that the males‚Äô 11kT levels correlated positively with ornamentation but negatively with immunocompetence, in particular, measures of innate immunity. Moreover, there was a trend for fish with high 11kT levels to suffer more from oxidative stress. Thus, our data provide support for the ICHH.},

The immunocompetence handicap hypothesis (ICHH) proposes that androgen-dependent sexual traits are honest indicators of male quality because androgens are thought to suppress the immune system‚Äôs ability to combat parasitic infection. Yet, recent work suggests that the relationship between androgens and parasitism is more complex, as androgens may have different effects on the various types of parasites. 2. We explored this issue in free-living mountain spiny lizards, Sceloporus jarrovi, by measuring the prevalence of four endoparasite species and one ectoparasite species in castrated, sham-operated and testosterone (T)-implanted males. 3. We found that effects of T manipulation accounted for the greatest amount of variability in the abundance of Trombiculid mites and two gastrointestinal nematodes (Physaloptera retusa and Spauligodon giganticus). Plasma T levels were positively associated with mite loads, negatively associated with P. retusa loads and not associated with S. giganticus load. We also found that T treatment had little effect on the abundances of two species of blood-borne endoparasites (Plasmodium chiricahuae and an unidentified haemogregarine). Instead, the prevalence of these two parasites was mostly influenced by other physiological or seasonal factors, such as corticosterone levels, body condition, fat stores or time between capture events. 4. Our data illustrate that T can have functionally distinct and opposing effects on different parasite species. This finding supports the hypothesis that T does not depress the immune system in a way that causes an across-the-board increase in parasitism. 5. We speculate that T modifies select behavioural and physiological factors that govern parasite accumulation. Evolutionarily, our data also imply that the net ‚Äòcost of T‚Äô with respect to elevated ectoparasitism may be at least partially offset by concomitant reductions in helminth load.},

	abstract = {It has been argued that females should be able to choose parasite-resistant mates on the basis of the quality of male secondary sexual characters and that such signals must be costly handicaps in order to evolve. To a large extent, handicap hypotheses have relied on energetic explanations for these costs. Here, we have presented a phenomenological model, operating on an intraspecific level, which views the cost of secondary sexual development from an endocrinological perspective. The primary androgenic hormone, testosterone, has a dualistic effect; it stimulates development of characteristics used in sexual selection while reducing immunocompetence. This "double-edged sword" creates a physiological trade-off that influences and is influenced by parasite burden. We propose a negative-feedback loop between signal intensity and parasite burden by suggesting that testosterone-dependent signal intensity is a plastic response. This response is modified in accordance with the competing demands of the potential costs of parasite infection versus that of increased reproductive success afforded by exaggerated signals. We clarify how this trade-off is intimately involved in the evolution of secondary sexual characteristics and how it may explain some of the equivocal empirical results that have surfaced in attempts to quantify parasite's effect on sexual selection.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Hamilton \& Zuk (1982) hypothesis of parasite-mediated sexual selection has been the subject of both inter- and intraspecific tests. Past reviews have used vote counting to determine whether this hypothesis is supported by empirical evidence. This study reanalysed 199 separate quantitative assessments of a central prediction of the Hamilton \& Zuk hypothesis using meta-analytical techniques. Overall, our meta-analysis showed that there was a significant negative effect of parasites on male showiness as predicted. However the magnitude of this effect varied between host taxa and between endo and ectoparasitic taxa. As a whole intraspecific correlations between parasite load and male showiness provided very little support for the hypothesis with only the effect of parasites on fish morphology matching the Hamilton \& Zuk prediction. There was more support for the hypothesis from interspecific studies especially those based upon the original Hamilton \& Zuk (1982) data set, although other bird studies provided weaker support. The generality of the Hamilton \& Zuk hypothesis in respect to parasite mediated sexual selection across taxa is thrown into doubt by these results. However, in some specific host-parasite systems the role of parasites appears important and future intraspecific tests of parasite-mediated sexual selection should perhaps focus on such systems.},

	abstract = {Female preferences for specific male phenotypes have been documented across a wide range of animal taxa, including numerous species where males contribute only gametes to offspring production. Yet, selective pressures maintaining such preferences are among the major unknowns of evolutionary biology. Theoretical studies suggest that preferences can evolve if they confer genetic benefits in terms of increased attractiveness of sons (‚ÄúFisherian‚Äù models) or overall fitness of offspring (‚Äúgood genes‚Äù models). These two types of models predict, respectively, that male attractiveness is heritable and genetically correlated with fitness. In this meta-analysis, we draw general conclusions from over two decades worth of empirical studies testing these predictions (90 studies on 55 species in total). We found evidence for heritability of male attractiveness. However, attractiveness showed no association with traits directly associated with fitness (life-history traits). Interestingly, it did show a positive correlation with physiological traits, which include immunocompetence and condition. In conclusion, our results support ‚ÄúFisherian‚Äù models of preference evolution, while providing equivocal evidence for ‚Äúgood genes.‚Äù We pinpoint research directions that should stimulate progress in our understanding of the evolution of female choice.},

	abstract = {Hamilton and Zuk proposed a good-genes model of sexual selection in which genetic variation can be maintained when females prefer ornaments that indicate resistance to parasites. When trait expression depends on a male‚Äôs resistance, the co-adaptive cycles between host resistance and parasite virulence provide a mechanism in which genetic variation for fitness is continually renewed. The model made predictions at both the intraspecific and interspecific levels. In the three decades since its publication, these predictions have been theoretically examined in models of varying complexity, and empirically tested across many vertebrate and invertebrate taxa. Despite such prolonged interest, however, it has turned out to be extremely difficult to empirically demonstrate the process described, in part because we have not been able to test the underlying mechanisms that would unequivocally identify how parasites act as mediators of sexual selection. Here, we discuss how the use of high-throughput sequencing datasets available from modern genomic approaches might improve our ability to test this model. We expect that important contributions will come through the ability to identify and quantify the suite of parasites likely to influence the evolution of hosts‚Äô resistance, to confidently reconstruct phylogenies of both host and parasite taxa, and, perhaps most exciting, to detect generational cycles of heritable variants in populations of hosts and parasites. Integrative approaches, building on systems undergoing parasite-mediated selection with genomic resources already available, will be particularly useful in moving toward robust tests of this hypothesis. We finish by presenting case studies of well-studied host‚Äìparasite relationships that represent promising avenues for future research.},

The HZH predicts that infected hosts will produce poorer sexual ornamentation than uninfected individuals as a result of energetic trade-offs between immune and signalling functions. To test whether there is a negative relationship between spectral brightness and pigment content in the skin of lizards, we used spectrophotometry to quantify the changes in spectral brightness of colour patches of two species after chemically manipulating the contents of orange, yellow and black pigments in skin samples. Carotenoids were identified using high-performance liquid chromatography. In addition, we compared the spectral brightness in the colour patches of live individuals with differential expression of nuptial coloration. Overall, the analyses demonstrated that the more pigmented the colour patch, the darker the spectrum. We provide a comprehensive interpretation of how variation in pigment content affects the spectral brightness of the colour patches of lizards. Furthermore, we review 18 studies of lizards presenting 24 intraspecific tests of the HZH and show that 14 (58\%) of the tests do not support the hypothesis.},

	abstract = {The effects of sex hormones on immune function have received much attention, especially following the proposal of the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis. Many studies, both experimental and correlational, have been conducted to test the relationship between immune function and the sex hormones testosterone in males and oestrogen in females. However, the results are mixed. We conducted four cross-species meta-analyses to investigate the relationship between sex hormones and immune function: (i) the effect of testosterone manipulation on immune function in males, (ii) the correlation between circulating testosterone level and immune function in males, (iii) the effect of oestrogen manipulation on immune function in females, and (iv) the correlation between circulating oestrogen level and immune function in females. The results from the experimental studies showed that testosterone had a medium-sized immunosuppressive effect on immune function. The effect of oestrogen, on the other hand, depended on the immune measure used. Oestrogen suppressed cell-mediated immune function while reducing parasite loads. The overall correlation (meta-analytic relationship) between circulating sex hormone level and immune function was not statistically significant for either testosterone or oestrogen despite the power of meta-analysis. These results suggest that correlational studies have limited value for testing the effects of sex hormones on immune function. We found little evidence of publication bias in the four data sets using indirect tests. There was a weak and positive relationship between year of publication and effect size for experimental studies of testosterone that became non-significant after we controlled for castration and immune measure, suggesting that the temporal trend was due to changes in these moderators over time. Graphical analyses suggest that the temporal trend was due to an increased use of cytokine measures across time. We found substantial heterogeneity in effect sizes, except in correlational studies of testosterone, even after we accounted for the relevant random and fixed factors. In conclusion, our results provide good evidence that testosterone suppresses immune function and that the effect of oestrogen varies depending on the immune measure used.},

Studies of specific host-parasite systems and comparative analyses have revealed both supportive and conflicting evidence for these hypotheses. A meta-analysis of the available evidence revealed a negative relationship between parasite load and the expression of male secondary sexual characters. Experimental studies yielded more strongly negative relationships than observations did, and the relationships were more strongly negative for ectoparasites than for endoparasites. There was no significant difference in the magnitude of the negative effect for species with and without male parental care, or between behavioral and morphological secondary sexual characters. There was a significant difference between studies based on host immune function and those based on parasite loads, with stronger effects for measures of immune function, suggesting that the many negative results from previous analyses of parasite-mediated sexual selection may be explained because relatively benign parasites were studied. The multivariate analyses demonstrating strong effect sizes of immune function in relation to the expression of secondary sexual characters, and for species with male parental care as compared to those without, suggest that parasite resistance may be a general determinant of parasite-mediated sexual selection.},

The relationship was apparent for both the colour and brightness of signals and was slightly stronger for iridescent ornaments.

	abstract = {The Hamilton‚ÄêZuk hypothesis, that parasite‚Äêhost coevolution can maintain heritable variation in fitness, has inspired a very successful research program on sexual selection on signals of health. The immunocompetence handicap hypothesis was developed to provide a handicapping mechanism to stabilize the correlation between signals and health. In earlier articles, I showed that handicap signaling is a special case, not a general law that we can rely on to deduce relative costs across signalers of different quality at equilibrium. The essential requirement for reliable signaling is that higher‚Äêquality signalers are more efficient; they get greater marginal fitness returns from an incremental increase in the signal. This does not undermine the Hamilton‚ÄêZuk hypothesis or the immunocompetence mechanism, but it does raise doubts about a widespread assumption that is commonly used to test these hypotheses: that sexual selection on signals of health implies the choice of mates with the fewest parasites. Immunity and parasites might play a fundamental role in many biological signaling systems, but viability‚Äêindicating traits are not necessarily parasite‚Äêload‚Äêindicating traits. Theory allows for the possibility that high‚Äêquality big signalers have greater health and more parasites than low‚Äêquality small signalers (and the data suggest that in many systems they do). This means that we cannot test the Hamilton‚ÄêZuk hypothesis or the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis by counting parasites. More generally, we cannot understand sexual selection on signals of health by focusing on the viability costs of signals.},

The association is stable, and the Wolbachia strain is maternally inherited at high frequency. It is capable of inducing complete cytoplasmic incompatibility, which should facilitate its invasion into natural field populations and its persistence over time.

	abstract = {As many strategies to control malaria use insecticides against adult mosquitoes, control is undermined by the continual evolution of resistant mosquitoes. Here we suggest that using alternative insecticides, or conventional insecticides in alternative ways might enable effective control, but delay considerably or prevent the evolution of resistance. Our reasoning relies on an epidemiological and an evolutionary principle: (i) the epidemiology of malaria is strongly influenced by the life-span of mosquitoes, as most infected mosquitoes die before the malaria parasite has completed its development; and (ii) evolutionary pressure is strongest in young individuals, for selection on individuals that have completed most of their reproduction has little evolutionary effect. It follows from these principles, first, that insecticides that kill mosquitoes several days after exposure can delay considerably the evolution of resistance and, second, that the evolution of resistance against larvicides can actually benefit control, if it is associated with shorter life-span or reduced biting in adults. If a late-acting insecticide and a larvicide are combined, the evolution of resistance against larvicides can in some circumstances prevent the evolution of resistance against the more effective, late-acting insecticide, leading to sustainable, effective control. We discuss several potential options to create such insecticides, focussing on biopesticides.},

	abstract = {The global expansion of Aedes albopictus together with the absence of vaccines for most of the arboviruses transmitted by this mosquito has stimulated the development of sterile-male strategies aiming at controlling disease transmission through the suppression of natural vector populations. In this context, two environmentally friendly control strategies, namely the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) and the Wolbachia-based Incompatible Insect Technique (IIT) are currently being developed in several laboratories worldwide. So far however, there is a lack of comparative assessment of these strategies under the same controlled conditions. Here, we compared the mating capacities, i.e. insemination capacity, sterilization capacity and mating competitiveness of irradiated (35 Gy) and incompatible Ae. albopictus males at different ages and ratios under laboratory controlled conditions. Our data show that there was no significant difference in insemination capacity of irradiated and incompatible males, both male types showing lower capacities than untreated males at 1 day but recovering full capacity within 5 days following emergence. Regarding mating competitiveness trials, a global observed trend is that incompatible males tend to induce a lower hatching rate than irradiated males in cage controlled confrontations. More specifically, incompatible males were found more competitive than irradiated males in 5:1 ratio regardless of age, while irradiated males were only found more competitive than incompatible males in the 1:1 ratio at 10 days old. Overall, under the tested conditions, IIT seemed to be slightly more effective than SIT. However, considering that a single strategy will likely not be adapted to all environments, our data stimulates the need for comparative assessments of distinct strategies in up-scaled conditions in order to identify the most suitable and safe sterilizing technology to be implemented in a specific environmental setting and to identify the parameters requiring fine tuning in order to reach optimal release conditions.},

The essays deal with some of the central problems of biology. These are among the questions put and answered from the standpoint of modern experimental biology. What is ageing and how is it measured? What theories have been held to account for it, and with what success? Did ageing evolve, and if so how? Is Lamarckism and adequate explanation of evolutionary process? Does evolution sometimes go wrong? Do human beings evolve in a way peculiar to themselves? Other essays touch upon the problems of scientific method and of growth and transformation. This book will be of interest to natural historians, evolutionists and anthropologists.},

	abstract = {House construction is rapidly modernizing across Africa but the potential benefits for human health are poorly understood. We hypothesised that improvements to housing would be associated with reductions in malaria, acute respiratory infection (ARI) and gastrointestinal illness in an area of low malaria endemicity in Uganda. Data were analysed from a cohort study of male and female child and adult residents (n = 531) of 80 randomly-selected households in Nagongera sub-county, followed for 24 months (October 4, 2017 to October 31, 2019). Houses were classified as modern (brick walls, metal roof and closed eaves) or traditional (all other homes). Light trap collections of mosquitoes were done every two weeks in all sleeping rooms. Every four weeks, we measured malaria infection (using microscopy and qPCR to detect malaria parasites), incidence of malaria, ARI and gastrointestinal illness. We collected 15,780 adult female Anopheles over 7,631 nights. We collected 13,277 blood samples of which 10.2\% (1,347) were positive for malaria parasites. Over 958 person years we diagnosed 38 episodes of uncomplicated malaria (incidence 0.04 episodes per person-year at risk), 2,553 episodes of ARI (incidence 2.7 episodes per person-year) and 387 episodes of gastrointestinal illness (incidence 0.4 episodes per person-year). Modern houses were associated with a 53\% lower human biting rate compared to traditional houses (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] 0.47, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.32‚Äì0.67, p{\textless}0.001) and a 24\% lower incidence of gastrointestinal illness (aIRR 0.76, 95\% CI 0.59‚Äì0.98, p = 0.04) but no changes in malaria prevalence, malaria incidence nor ARI incidence. House improvements may reduce mosquito-biting rates and gastrointestinal illness among children and adults. For the health sector to leverage Africa‚Äôs housing modernization, research is urgently needed to identify the healthiest house designs and to assess their effectiveness across a range of epidemiological settings in sub-Saharan Africa.},

By choosing such males as mates, females will rear offspring carrying the genes for resistance. I tested three necessary conditions for the Hamilton and Zuk model: (1) whether parasites affect the fitness of their hosts; (2) whether there is heritable variation in parasite resistance, and (3) whether the expression of the sexual ornament varies with parasite burden. The haematophagous mite Ornithonyssus bursa (Macronyssidae, Gamasida) sucks blood from their Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica) hosts. Experimental manipulation of mite loads and partial cross-fostering experiments on Barn Swallows, where half of the nestlings in the brood were exchanged with nestlings from another nest, shows that parasite burdens and origin, but not rearing conditions, of Bam Swallow nestlings, affected their adult tarsus length and maximum body weight shortly before fledging. Mite loads of adult Barn Swallows at spring arrival were more similar to mite loads of their own offspring, whether reared in their own or in foster nests inoculated with mites, than to loads of foster offspring. Parent Barn Swallows with long tail ornaments had offspring with smaller mite loads in the partial cross-fostering experiments. The amount of increase in male tail ornaments from one year to another was negatively related to experimentally manipulated mite loads of Barn Swallow nests during the preceding breeding season. In conclusion, the three assumptions of the hypothesis were supported by the experimental tests.},

Five hundred male guppies from 19 distinct populations in the Northern Range of Trinidad were inspected for Gyrodactylus parasites and photographed. Eight measures of orange spot ornamentation were used to test the predictions: hue, saturation, lightness, relative area, number, and area-weighted hue, saturation, and lightness. Parasite load had no significant effect on any of these measures. There was also no relationship between orange spot ornamentation and parasite abundance among populations. Guppies from high-predation environments had significantly more parasites, and their orange coloration was lighter and less saturated than that in guppies from low-predation environments. Despite previous lab results, this study found no relationship between parasite load and male orange spot ornamentation.},

Past reviews have used vote counting to determine whether this hypothesis is supported by empirical evidence. This study reanalysed 199 separate quantitative assessments of a central prediction of the Hamilton \& Zuk hypothesis using meta-analytical techniques. Overall, our meta-analysis showed that there was a significant negative effect of parasites on male showiness as predicted. However the magnitude of this effect varied between host taxa and between endo and ectoparasitic taxa. As a whole intraspecific correlations between parasite load and male showiness provided very little support for the hypothesis with only the effect of parasites on fish morphology matching the Hamilton \& Zuk prediction. There was more support for the hypothesis from interspecific studies especially those based upon the original Hamilton \& Zuk (1982) data set, although other bird studies provided weaker support. The generality of the Hamilton \& Zuk hypothesis in respect to parasite mediated sexual selection across taxa is thrown into doubt by these results. However, in some specific host-parasite systems the role of parasites appears important and future intraspecific tests of parasite-mediated sexual selection should perhaps focus on such systems.},

A large number of publications exist that have compiled and categorised correlations of parasitic infections and the occurrence of changes of phenotypic traits (e.g. behaviour, morphology, physiology) of their hosts. In this context, studies on fish parasites have documented an impact on almost every aspect of fish behaviour alongside changes in host morphology and/or physiology. This short review provides a quick and basic overview over the forms and diversity of parasite induced phenotypic changes in marine and freshwater fish species. Most frequently reported parasites and their correlated alterations were compiled from 57 publications and presented in a table. Behavioural changes were found among seven different parasite groups: Protozoa, Myxozoa, Digenea, Monogenea, Cestoda, Nematoda and Crustacea. Changes were categorized into five major categories: foraging, habitat selection, motility, predator avoidance and reproduction, whereas the most common behavioural change was involving motility with 34 cases, followed by predator avoidance (10), reproduction (8), foraging (5), and habitat selection (3). Most species involved in behavioural changes were found among the group of Digenea, with 13 different parasite species, followed by Cestoda with 6 different species. All other groups were more or less equally represented. Parasite specific forms of host manipulation are exemplified and discussed in the text.},

We compared multidimensionality in ‚Äòhost manipulation‚Äô between two closely related amphipods, Gammarus fossarum and Gammarus pulex, naturally and experimentally infected with Pomphorhynchus laevis (Acanthocephala), respectively. To that end, we calculated in each host‚Äìparasite association the effect size of the difference between infected and uninfected individuals for six different traits (activity, phototaxis, geotaxis, attraction to conspecifics, refuge use and metabolic rate). The effects sizes were highly correlated between host‚Äìparasite associations, providing evidence for a relatively constant ‚Äòinfection syndrome‚Äô. Using the same methodology, we compared the extent of phenotypic alterations induced by an experimental injection of serotonin (5-HT) in uninfected G. pulex to that induced by experimental or natural infection with P. laevis. We observed a significant correlation between effect sizes across the six traits, indicating that injection with 5-HT can faithfully mimic the ‚Äòinfection syndrome‚Äô. This is, to our knowledge, the first experimental evidence that multidimensionality in host manipulation can proceed, at least partly, from the disruption of some major physiological mechanism.},

	abstract = {Manipulative parasites can alter the phenotype of intermediate hosts in various ways. However, it is unclear whether such changes are just by-products of infection or adaptive and enhance transmission to the final host. Here, we show that the alteration of serotonergic activity is functionally linked to the alteration of specific behaviour in the amphipod Gammarus pulex infected with acanthocephalan parasites. Pomphorhynchus laevis and, to a lesser extent, Pomphorhynchus tereticollis altered phototactism, but not geotactism, in G. pulex, whereas the reverse was true for Polymorphus minutus. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) injected to uninfected G. pulex mimicked the altered phototactism, but had no effect on geotactism. Photophilic G. pulex infected with P. laevis or P. tereticollis showed a 40\% increase in brain 5-HT immunoreactivity compared to photophobic, uninfected individuals. In contrast, brain 5-HT immunoreactivity did not differ between P. minutus-infected and uninfected G. pulex. Finally, brain 5-HT immunoreactivity differed significantly among P. tereticollis-infected individuals in accordance with their degree of manipulation. Our results demonstrate that altered 5-HT activity is not the mere consequence of infection by acanthocephalans but is specifically linked to the disruption of host photophobic behaviour, whereas the alteration of other behaviours such as geotactism may rely on distinct physiological routes.},

	abstract = {Neuromodulators can resculpt neural circuits, giving an animal the behavioral flexibility it needs to survive in a complex changing world. This ability, however, provides parasites with a potential mechanism for manipulating host behavior. This paper reviews three invertebrate host-parasite systems to examine whether parasites can change host behavior by secreting neuromodulators. The parasitic wasp, \textit{Cotesia congregata}, suppresses host feeding partly by inducing the host \textit{(Manduca sexta)} to increase the octopamine concentration in its hemolymph. The increased octopamine concentration disrupts the motor pattern produced by the frontal ganglion, preventing the ingestion of food. \textit{Polymorphus paradoxus} (Acanthocephalan) alters the escape behavior of its host, \textit{Gammarus lacustris} (Crustacea), possibly through an effect on the host‚Äôs serotonergic system. The trematode \textit{Trichobilharzia ocellata} inhibits egg-laying in its snail host \textit{(Lymnaea stagnalis)}, partly by inducing the host to secrete schistosomin. Schistosomin decreases electrical excitability of the caudodorsal cells. The parasite also alters gene expression for some neuromodulators within the host‚Äôs central nervous system. In at least two of these three examples, it appears that the host, not the parasite, produces the neuromodulators that alter host behavior. Producing physiologically potent concentrations of neuromodulators may be energetically expensive for many parasites. Parasites may exploit indirect less energetically expensive methods of altering host behavior. For example, parasites may induce the host‚Äôs immune system to produce the appropriate neuromodulators. In many parasites, the ability to manipulate host behavior may have evolved from adaptations designed to circumvent the host‚Äôs immune system. Immune-neural-behavioral connections may be pre-adapted for parasitic manipulation.},

	abstract = {Accelerated body growth is associated with experimental infections with the plerocercoid stage of the pseudophyllidean tapeworm, Spirometra mansonoides. The growth response is due to a protein that is synthesized and released by plerocercoids in the host. Plerocercoid growth factor (PGF) is transported by the blood, interacts with growth hormone (GH) receptors and mimics many of the biological actions of GH. Purification and characterization of PGF reveals that the GH-like factor is a 27.5 kDa cysteine proteinase. Sequencing of a cDNA for PGF revealed 40‚Äì50\% homology to mammalian cysteine proteinases, but no homology to any GH. The GH-like factor/proteinase is found in abundance in the tegument of plerocercoids where the proteinase activity would be most effective in aiding tissue invasion, and possibly evasion, of the host's immune response to the parasite. The advantage of the GH-like activity is less clear, but it may affect the species survival by suppressing specific elements of the host's immune system and by improving the probability that the infected host will be eaten by a definitive host by increasing morbidity and/or mortality, conditions which are associated with long-term exposure to elevated levels of GH and PGF.},

	abstract = {Adaptation is the usual context for interpreting parasite-host interactions. For example, altered host behavior is often interpreted as a parasite adaptation, because in some cases it enhances parasite transmission. Resistance to parasites also has obvious adaptive value for hosts. However, it is difficult to evaluate the adaptive significance of host-parasite interactions without considering the historical context in which these traits have evolved and if they can be predicted by host (or parasite) phylogeny. We examined the influence of host phylogeny on patterns of altered behavior and resistance to parasitism in a cockroach-acanthocephalan system. A consensus cladogram for cockroach subfamilies was produced from the morphological data of McKittrick. We used this cladogram to predict patterns of altered host behavior in seven cockroach host species. Each species was experimentally infected with a single species of acanthocephalan, Moniliformis moniliformis, a parasite that is transmitted when cockroaches are eaten by rodent final hosts. Activity patterns, substrate choices, and responses to light were measured for control and infected animals. These data were recoded into a behavioral matrix of discrete characters. We determined the most parsimonious distribution of the behavioral characters on the tree obtained from McKittrick's data. We then measured the concordance between the behavioral data and the cockroach cladogram with the consistency index (CI). We compared the observed CI to the expected value based on a randomization of observed character states. For three different models of evolutionary character change, there was no evidence of strong concordance (significantly large CI) between altered host behavior and host relationships. Parsimony analysis of the interior nodes of the phylogenetic reconstruction suggested that unaltered behavior was the ancestral state for most host behaviors. We also compared host phylogeny to a data set on the susceptibility of 29 cockroach species to infection with M. moniliformis. At the species level, there was a significant concordance between susceptibility and host phylogeny. This pattern was consistent with the finding that susceptibility of species varied significantly among different subfamilies. However, at the subfamily level, susceptibility was not strongly concordant with phylogeny. We predict that, given enough time, resistance should be lost in subfamilies that are currently resistant to parasitism. In spite of the potential importance of phylogeny in the evolution of behavior and susceptibility, we found little evidence for phylogenetic effects in this system. We conclude that changes in the behavioral responses of hosts to parasites and, to a lesser extent, changes in susceptibility are more frequent than cockroach speciation events in different cockroach lineages. This finding strengthens the assertion that at least some of the altered behaviors are adaptive for host and/or parasite.},

	abstract = {Scientific and public interest in host manipulation by parasites has surged over the past few decades, resulting in an exponential growth of cases where potential behavioral manipulation has been identified. However, these studies dwarf the number of genuine attempts to elucidate the mechanistic processes behind this behavioral manipulation. Ultimately, this imbalance has slowed progress in the study of the mechanisms underlying host manipulation. As it stands, research suggests that the mechanisms of host manipulation fall into three categories: immunological, genomic/proteomic and neuropharmacological, and forth potential category: symbioant-mediated manipulation. After exploration of the literature pertaining to these four pathways, four major trends become evident. First and foremost, there is a severe disconnect between the observed molecular and behavioral shifts in a parasitized host. Indeed, very rarely a study demonstrates that molecular changes observed in a host are the result of active manipulation by the resident parasite, or that these molecular changes directly result in behavioral manipulation that increases the parasite's fitness. Secondly, parasites may often employ multiple pathways in unison to achieve control over their hosts. Despite this, current scientific approaches usually focus on each manipulation pathway in isolation rather than integrating them. Thirdly, the relative amount of host-parasite systems yet to be investigated in terms of molecular manipulation is staggering. Finally, as a result of the aforementioned trends, guiding mechanisms or principles for the multiple types of behavioral manipulation are yet to be found. Researchers should look to identify the manipulative factors required to generate the molecular changes seen in hosts, while also considering the ‚Äúmulti-pronged‚Äù approach parasites are taking to manipulate behavior. Assessing gene expression and its products during transitional periods in parasites may be a key methodological approach for tackling these recent trends in the host manipulation literature.},

Bizarrely, rats infected with the brain parasite Toxoplasma gondii approach the cat odors they typically avoid. Since the protozoan Toxoplasma requires the cat to sexually reproduce, this change in host behavior is thought to be a remarkable example of a parasite manipulating a mammalian host for its own benefit. Toxoplasma does not influence host response to non-feline predator odor nor does it alter behavior on olfactory, social, fear or anxiety tests, arguing for specific manipulation in the processing of cat odor. We report that Toxoplasma infection alters neural activity in limbic brain areas necessary for innate defensive behavior in response to cat odor. Moreover, Toxoplasma increases activity in nearby limbic regions of sexual attraction when the rat is exposed to cat urine, compelling evidence that Toxoplasma overwhelms the innate fear response by causing, in its stead, a type of sexual attraction to the normally aversive cat odor.},

Infecting 40 million Americans, Toxoplasma gondii is known to cause congenital infections, eye disease, and encephalitis for individuals who are immunosuppressed. It has also been shown to change the behavior of nonhuman mammals, as well as to alter some personality traits in humans. After discussing the clinical evidence linking Toxoplasma gondii to human psychosis, the book elucidates the epidemiological evidence further supporting this linkage; including the proportional increase in incidence of human psychosis as cats transitioned to domestication over 800 years.

	abstract = {Background
Common infectious pathogens have been associated with psychiatric disorders, self-violence and risk-taking behavior.
Methods
This case-control study reviews register data on 81,912 individuals from the Danish Blood Donor Study to identify individuals who have a psychiatric diagnosis (N‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ2591), have attempted or committed suicide (N‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ655), or have had traffic accidents (N‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ2724). For all cases, controls were frequency matched by age and sex, resulting in 11,546 participants. Plasma samples were analyzed for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii and cytomegalovirus (CMV).
Results
T. gondii was detected in 25¬∑9\% of the population and was associated with schizophrenia (odds ratio [OR], 1¬∑47; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1¬∑03‚Äì2¬∑09). Accounting for temporality, with pathogen exposure preceding outcome, the association was even stronger (IRR, 2¬∑78; 95\% CI, 1¬∑27‚Äì6¬∑09). A very weak association between traffic accident and toxoplasmosis (OR, 1¬∑11; 95\% CI, 1¬∑00‚Äì1¬∑23, p‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.054) was found. CMV was detected in 60¬∑8\% of the studied population and was associated with any psychiatric disorder (OR, 1¬∑17; 95\% CI, 1¬∑06‚Äì1¬∑29), but also with a smaller group of neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders (OR, 1¬∑27; 95\% CI, 1¬∑12‚Äì1¬∑44), and with attempting or committing suicide (OR, 1¬∑31; 95\% CI, 1¬∑10‚Äì1¬∑56). Accounting for temporality, any psychiatric disorder (IRR, 1¬∑37; 95\% CI, 1¬∑08‚Äì1¬∑74) and mood disorders (IRR, 1¬∑43; 95\% CI, 1¬∑01‚Äì2¬∑04) were associated with exposure to CMV. No association between traffic accident and CMV (OR, 1¬∑06; 95\% CI, 0¬∑97‚Äì1¬∑17) was found.
Conclusions
This large-scale serological study is the first study to examine temporality of pathogen exposure and to provide evidence of a causal relationship between T. gondii and schizophrenia, and between CMV and any psychiatric disorder.},

Spurious or non-causal correlations between aggregate personality and aspects of climate and culture that influence T. gondii transmission could also drive these patterns. A link between culture and T. gondii hypothetically results from a behavioural manipulation that the parasite uses to increase its transmission to the next host in the life cycle: a cat. While latent toxoplasmosis is usually benign, the parasite's subtle effect on individual personality appears to alter the aggregate personality at the population level. Drivers of the geographical variation in the prevalence of this parasite include the effects of climate on the persistence of infectious stages in soil, the cultural practices of food preparation and cats as pets. Some variation in culture, therefore, may ultimately be related to how climate affects the distribution of T. gondii, though the results only explain a fraction of the variation in two of the four cultural dimensions, suggesting that if T. gondii does influence human culture, it is only one among many factors.},

individuals. The ability to bury proved to be highly repeatable in 
field experiments: cockles found at the surface and 
transplanted to an experimental area did not bury themselves, and cockles
 
found buried stayed buried when relocated. All 
metacercariae of C. australis were found strictly in the foot
 and 
for each of 3 samples collected in different sites, there was 
a negative and significant relationship between the relative length of
 the 
foot and the parasite load. A predation test 
conducted under natural conditions indicated that cockles with the stunted
 
foot and the altered behaviour are significantly 
more susceptible to predation by aquatic birds than other cockles. Given
 
that the definitive host of C. australis is an 
oystercatcher, we first discuss our results in the context of 
transmission strategy. Comparisons with other studies on more 
or less related trematode species parasitic in bivalves and evolving under
 
similar constraints for their transmission, shed 
light on the origin of this adaptation in C. australis.},

Here I develop an optimality model of the extent of host manipulation, incorporating within-host group size, relatedness and a range of realistic cost‚Äìbenefit functions. The model highlights the cooperative nature of host manipulation, and the potential for cheating this entails. When relatedness in parasite groups is minimal, manipulation is suppressed, but not eradicated, reflecting the importance of interhost selection. A distinctive threshold phenomenon is predicted for a wide range of parameter values. Below the group size threshold, manipulation is zero. Above the threshold, the predicted behaviour depends critically on the biological details of the individual‚Äìgroup interaction. The host‚Äìmanipulation model is discussed in the light of two potential applications. If parasite group size is assumed to be a static characteristic of a parasite species or strain, the model generates a set of comparative predictions best suited to macroparasite systems. Additionally, the model can be used to predict density‚Äìdependent behavioural changes in expanding groups of parasites, as seen in quorum-sensing bacteria.},

I exposed juvenile pulmonate snails from two populations of the hermaphrodite Lymnaea peregra to infections with the trematode Diplostomum phoxini. Only one of the two snail populations studied is naturally in contact with this parasite (P$^{\textrm{+}}$) and the other is not (P$^{\textrm{-}}$). 3. Diplostomum phoxini induced gigantism only in P$^{\textrm{+}}$ snails. Furthermore, P$^{\textrm{+}}$ snails showed a lower parasite-induced mortality compared to P$^{\textrm{-}}$ snails but infected P$^{\textrm{+}}$ snails did not lay eggs before they died. 4. These results are in agreement with three out of four predictions derived from the hypothesis of gigantism as a host adaptation. The fourth prediction, that some P$^{\textrm{+}}$ snails should survive long enough to outlive the infection and reproduce, was not met. 5. My results do not directly support the idea that parasite-induced gigantism is of adaptive value for L. peregra but suggest that gigantism is unlikely to be purely a parasite adaptation. This study cannot exclude the alternative hypothesis that gigantism is a non-adaptive side-effect of infection.},

Accordingly, many organisms try to detect and avoid infective parasite stages, leading to changes in host behavior or physiology. Such non-consumptive effects (NCEs) on host traits can have cascading impacts on whole ecosystems but remain largely overlooked. Here, we discuss the potential impacts of the presence of free-living trematode stages on blue mussels Mytilus edulis, an important ecosystem engineer in coastal habitats, and highlight the ecological implications of these interactions. Specifically, we discuss how parasite avoidance behavior can regulate the filtration activity of these bivalves in coastal ecosystems and show how even moderate changes in mussel behavior can lead to far-reaching shifts in energy flow. Such processes might be further amplified under future climate change developments, since both parasite abundance and biotic productivity are highly temperature dependent. Overall, we hypothesize that, in addition to their more evident consumptive impacts, trematodes act as cryptic ecosystem engineers by shaping bivalve filtration processes via NCEs. Due to our still very limited understanding of these parasite-mediated processes, we outline key questions for future research directions. We hope this perspective will help encourage new efforts to empirically investigate these fascinating processes that can be crucial regulatory forces in complex ecological systems.},

	abstract = {The immunocompetence handicap hypothesis was formulated 12 years ago in an attempt to offer a proximate mechanism by which female choice of males could be explained by endocrine control of honest signalling. The hypothesis suggested that testosterone has a dual effect in males of controlling the development of sexual signals while causing immunosuppression. Our purpose in this review is to examine the empirical evidence to date that has attempted to test the hypothesis, and to conduct a meta-analysis on two of the assumptions of the hypothesis, that testosterone reduces immunocompetence and increases parasitism, to ascertain any statistical trend in the data. There is some evidence to suggest that testosterone is responsible for the magnitude of trait expression or development of sexual traits, but this is by no means conclusive. The results of many studies attempting to find evidence for the supposed immunosuppressive qualities of testosterone are difficult to interpret since they are observational rather than experimental. Of the experimental studies, the data obtained are ambiguous, and this is reflected in the result of the meta-analysis. Overall, the meta-analysis found a significant suppressive effect of testosterone on immunity, in support of the hypothesis, but this effect disappeared when we controlled for multiple studies on the same species. There was no effect of testosterone on direct measures of immunity, but it did increase ectoparasite abundance in several studies, in particular in reptiles. A funnel analysis indicated that the results were robust to a publication bias. Alternative substances that interact with testosterone, such as glucocorticoids, may be important. Ultimately, a greater understanding is required of the complex relationships that exist both within and between the endocrine and immune systems and their consequences for mate choice decision making.},

	abstract = {Many bird species have patches of colour in their plumage, contrasting with their basic coloration, which are used to display and signal status to conspecifics. These are called ‚Äòbadges of status‚Äô, because they are believed to be low-cost signals of social status. For a signalling system to be evolutionarily stable, cheating must be controlled. The conventional view is that there is frequent testing, which uncovers cheats. Recently, the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis (ICHH) suggested that signals may be dependent on testosterone for their development, with a cost being imposed through immune suppression. We report experiments on house sparrows (Passer domesticus) which show that testosterone significantly influences the size of the bib (a ‚Äòbadge of status‚Äô). The ultimate effect of the testosterone manipulation was to impair antibody production, as predicted by the ICHH. However, testosterone manipulations also changed the levels of the ‚Äòstress hormone‚Äô corticosterone. The level of corticosterone was also related to the degree of immunosuppression. After controlling for the effect of corticosterone, testosterone enhanced the birds‚Äô ability to produce antibodies, counter to the ICHH. The hypothesis therefore must be modified. We suggest that testosterone has a dual effect: it leads to immunosuppression through a mechanism involving corticosterone but, conversely, leads to increased immunocompetence probably via dominance influencing access to resources.},

The direct means by which the most colorful males achieve superior health has been debated, however. One hypothesis, based on studies of carotenoids as antioxidants in humans and other animals, is that carotenoids directly boost the immune system of colorful birds. We studied the relationship between carotenoid pigments, immune function, and sexual coloration in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), a species in which males incorporate carotenoid pigments into their beak to attract mates. We tested the hypotheses that increased dietary carotenoid intake enhances immunocompetence in male zebra finches and that levels of carotenoids circulating in blood, which also determine beak coloration, directly predict the immune response of individuals. We experimentally supplemented captive finches with two common dietary carotenoid pigments (lutein and zeaxanthin) and measured cell‚Äêmediated and humoral immunity a month later. Supplemented males showed elevated blood‚Äêcarotenoid levels, brighter beak coloration, and increased cell‚Äêmediated and humoral immune responses than did controls. Cell‚Äêmediated responses were predicted directly by changes in beak color and plasma carotenoid concentration of individual birds. These experimental findings suggest that carotenoid‚Äêbased color signals in birds may directly signal male health via the immunostimulatory action of ingested and circulated carotenoid pigments.},

Using a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis of 357 effect sizes across 88 different species of birds, we tested two prominent hypotheses in the field: that carotenoid-dependent coloration signals i) immunocompetence and/or ii) oxidative stress state. Separate meta-analyses were performed for the relationships of trait coloration and circulating carotenoid level with different measures of immunocompetence and oxidative stress state. For immunocompetence we find that carotenoid levels (r = 0.20) and trait color intensity (r = 0.17) are significantly positively related to PHA response. Additionally we find that carotenoids are significantly positively related to antioxidant capacity (r = 0.10), but not significantly related to oxidative damage (r = ‚àí0.02). Thus our analyses provide support for both hypotheses, in that at least for some aspects of immunity and oxidative stress state the predicted correlations were found. Furthermore, we tested for differences in effect size between experimental and observational studies; a larger effect in observational studies would indicate that co-variation might not be causal. However, we detected no significant difference, suggesting that the relationships we found are causal. The overall effect sizes we report are modest and we discuss potential factors contributing to this, including differences between species. We suggest complementary mechanisms maintaining honesty rather than the involvement of carotenoids in immune function and oxidative stress and suggest experiments on how to test these.},

	abstract = {Background Extravagant ornaments used as social signals evolved to advertise their bearers' quality. The Immunocompetence Handicap Hypothesis proposes that testosterone-dependent ornaments reliably signal health and parasite resistance; however, empirical studies have shown mixed support. Alternatively, immune function and parasite resistance may be indirectly or directly related to glucocorticoid stress hormones. We propose that an understanding of the interplay between the individual and its environment, particularly how they cope with stressors, is crucial for understanding the honesty of social signals. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed corticosterone deposited in growing feathers as an integrated measure of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity in a wild territorial bird, the red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus. We manipulated two key, interrelated components, parasites and testosterone, which influence both ornamentation and fitness. Birds were initially purged of parasites, and later challenged with parasites or not, while at the same time being given testosterone or control implants, using a factorial experimental design. At the treatment level, testosterone enhanced ornamentation, while parasites reduced it, but only in males not implanted with testosterone. Among individuals, the degree to which both parasites and testosterone had an effect was strongly dependent on the amount of corticosterone in the feather grown during the experiment. The more stressors birds had experienced (i.e., higher corticosterone), the more parasites developed, and the less testosterone enhanced ornamentation. Conclusions/Significance With this unique focus on the individual, and a novel, integrative, measure of response to stressors, we show that ornamentation is ultimately a product of the cumulative physiological response to environmental challenges. These findings lead toward a more realistic concept of honesty in signaling as well as a broader discussion of the concept of stress.},

Here we show positive relationships between testosterone, facial attractiveness and immune function (antibody response to a hepatitis B vaccine) in human males, and present some preliminary evidence that these relationships are moderated by naturally co-occurring cortisol (a glucocorticoid stress hormone involved in the fight-or-flight response).

We investigated the genetic underpinnings of host manipulation by: (i) producing a high-quality hybrid assembly and annotation of the Ophiocordyceps camponoti-floridani genome, (ii) conducting laboratory infections coupled with RNAseq of O. camponoti-floridani and its host, Camponotus floridanus, and (iii) comparing these data to RNAseq data of Ophiocordyceps kimflemingiae and Camponotus castaneus as a powerful method to identify gene expression patterns that suggest shared behavioral manipulation mechanisms across Ophiocordyceps-ant species interactions. We propose differentially expressed genes tied to ant neurobiology, odor response, circadian rhythms, and foraging behavior may result by activity of putative fungal effectors such as enterotoxins, aflatrem, and mechanisms disrupting feeding behaviors in the ant.},

Here we show that a recent mass extinction associated with pathogen outbreaks is tied to global warming. Seventeen years ago, in the mountains of Costa Rica, the Monteverde harlequin frog (Atelopus sp.) vanished along with the golden toad (Bufo periglenes). An estimated 67\% of the 110 or so species of Atelopus, which are endemic to the American tropics, have met the same fate, and a pathogenic chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) is implicated. Analysing the timing of losses in relation to changes in sea surface and air temperatures, we conclude with ‚Äòvery high confidence‚Äô ({\textgreater} 99\%, following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC) that large-scale warming is a key factor in the disappearances. We propose that temperatures at many highland localities are shifting towards the growth optimum of Batrachochytrium, thus encouraging outbreaks. With climate change promoting infectious disease and eroding biodiversity, the urgency of reducing greenhouse-gas concentrations is now undeniable.},

Using rodents as an example, we incorporate statistical differences in the life history features of zoonotic reservoir hosts into pathogen transmission models, enabling us to bound the range of dynamical phenomena associated with hosts, based on their traits. We then test for associations between equilibrium prevalence, a key epidemiological metric and data on human outbreaks of rodent-borne zoonoses, identifying matches between empirical evidence and theoretical predictions of transmission dynamics. We show how this framework can be generalized to other systems through a rubric of disease models and parameters that can be derived from empirical data. By linking life history components directly to their effects on disease dynamics, our mining-modelling approach integrates machine learning and theoretical models to explore mechanisms in the macroecology of pathogen transmission and their consequences for spillover infection to humans.},

Advances in global disease surveillance are increasingly generating datasets that are worth more than their component parts for prediction-oriented work. Here, we use a trait-free approach which leverages information on the global community of human infectious diseases to predict the biogeography of pathogens through time. Our approach takes pairwise dissimilarities between countries‚Äô pathogen communities and pathogens‚Äô geographical distributions and uses these to predict country‚Äìpathogen associations. We compare the success rates of our model for predicting pathogen outbreak, emergence and re-emergence potential as a function of time (e.g. number of years between training and prediction), pathogen type (e.g. virus) and transmission mode (e.g. vector-borne). With only these simple predictors, our model successfully predicts basic network structure up to a decade into the future. We find that while outbreak and re-emergence potential are especially well captured by our simple model, prediction of emergence events remains more elusive, and sudden global emergences like an influenza pandemic are beyond the predictive capacity of the model. However, these stochastic pandemic events are unlikely to be predictable from such coarse data. Together, our model is able to use the information on the existing country‚Äìpathogen network to predict pathogen outbreaks fairly well, suggesting the importance in considering information on co-occurring pathogens in a more global view even to estimate outbreak events in a single location or for a single pathogen.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}After several pandemics over the last two millennia, the wildlife reservoirs of plague (Yersinia pestis) now persist around the world, including in the western United States. Routine surveillance in this region has generated comprehensive records of human cases and animal seroprevalence, creating a unique opportunity to test how plague reservoirs are responding to environmental change. Here, we develop a new method to detect the signal of climate change in infectious disease distributions, and test whether plague reservoirs and spillover risk have shifted since 1950. We find that plague foci are associated with high-elevation rodent communities, and soil biochemistry may play a key role in the geography of long-term persistence. In addition, we find that human cases are concentrated only in a small subset of endemic areas, and that spillover events are driven by higher rodent species richness (the amplification hypothesis) and climatic anomalies (the trophic cascade hypothesis). Using our detection model, we find that due to the changing climate, rodent communities at high elevations have become more conducive to the establishment of plague reservoirs - with suitability increasing up to 40\% in some places - and that spillover risk to humans at mid-elevations has increased as well, although more gradually. These results highlight opportunities for deeper investigation of plague ecology, the value of integrative surveillance for infectious disease geography, and the need for further research into ongoing climate change impacts.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to increased concern over transmission of pathogens from humans to animals, and its potential to threaten conservation and public health. To assess this threat, we reviewed published evidence of human-to-wildlife transmission events, with a focus on how such events could threaten animal and human health. We identified 97 verified examples, involving a wide range of pathogens; however, reported hosts were mostly non-human primates or large, long-lived captive animals. Relatively few documented examples resulted in morbidity and mortality, and very few led to maintenance of a human pathogen in a new reservoir or subsequent ‚Äúsecondary spillover‚Äù back into humans. We discuss limitations in the literature surrounding these phenomena, including strong evidence of sampling bias towards non-human primates and human-proximate mammals and the possibility of systematic bias against reporting human parasites in wildlife, both of which limit our ability to assess the risk of human-to-wildlife pathogen transmission. We outline how researchers can collect experimental and observational evidence that will expand our capacity for risk assessment for human-to-wildlife pathogen transmission.},

	abstract = {In the light of the urgency raised by the COVID-19 pandemic, global investment in wildlife virology is likely to increase, and new surveillance programmes will identify hundreds of novel viruses that might someday pose a threat to humans. To support the extensive task of laboratory characterization, scientists may increasingly rely on data-driven rubrics or machine learning models that learn from known zoonoses to identify which animal pathogens could someday pose a threat to global health. We synthesize the findings of an interdisciplinary workshop on zoonotic risk technologies to answer the following questions. What are the prerequisites, in terms of open data, equity and interdisciplinary collaboration, to the development and application of those tools? What effect could the technology have on global health? Who would control that technology, who would have access to it and who would benefit from it? Would it improve pandemic prevention? Could it create new challenges?

	abstract = {For decades, people have reduced the transmission of pathogens by adding low-quality hosts to managed environments like agricultural fields. More recently, there has been interest in whether similar ‚Äòdilution effects‚Äô occur in natural disease systems, and whether these effects are eroded as diversity declines. For some pathogens of plants, humans and other animals, the highest-quality hosts persist when diversity is lost, so that high-quality hosts dominate low-diversity communities, resulting in greater pathogen transmission. Meta-analyses reveal that these natural dilution effects are common. However, studying them remains challenging due to limitations on the ability of researchers to manipulate many disease systems experimentally, difficulties of acquiring data on host quality and confusion about what should and should not be considered a dilution effect. Because dilution effects are widely used in managed disease systems and have been documented in a variety of natural disease systems, their existence should not be considered controversial. Important questions remain about how frequently they occur and under what conditions to expect them. There is also ongoing confusion about their relationships to both pathogen spillover and general biogeographical correlations between diversity and disease, which has resulted in an inconsistent and confusing literature. Progress will require rigorous and creative research.},

	abstract = {The disease ecology community has struggled to come to consensus on whether biodiversity reduces or increases infectious disease risk, a question that directly affects policy decisions for biodiversity conservation and public health. Here, we summarize the primary points of contention regarding biodiversity‚Äìdisease relationships and suggest that vector-borne, generalist wildlife and zoonotic pathogens are the types of parasites most likely to be affected by changes to biodiversity. One synthesis on this topic revealed a positive correlation between biodiversity and human disease burden across countries, but as biodiversity changed over time within these countries, this correlation became weaker and more variable. Another synthesis‚Äîa meta-analysis of generally smaller-scale experimental and field studies‚Äîrevealed a negative correlation between biodiversity and infectious diseases (a dilution effect) in various host taxa. These results raise the question of whether biodiversity‚Äìdisease relationships are more negative at smaller spatial scales. If so, biodiversity conservation at the appropriate scales might prevent wildlife and zoonotic diseases from increasing in prevalence or becoming problematic (general proactive approaches). Further, protecting natural areas from human incursion should reduce zoonotic disease spillover. By contrast, for some infectious diseases, managing particular species or habitats and targeted biomedical approaches (targeted reactive approaches) might outperform biodiversity conservation as a tool for disease control. Importantly, biodiversity conservation and management need to be considered alongside other disease management options. These suggested guiding principles should provide common ground that can enhance scientific and policy clarity for those interested in simultaneously improving wildlife and human health.},

	abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-transmitted disease of birds that has caused bird population declines and can spill over into human populations. Previous research has identified bird species that infect a large fraction of the total pool of infected mosquitoes and correlate with human infection risk; however, these analyses cover small spatial regions and cannot be used to predict transmission in bird communities in which these species are rare or absent. Here we present a mechanistic model for WNV transmission that predicts WNV spread (R0) in any bird community in North America by scaling up from the physiological responses of individual birds to transmission at the level of the community. We predict unmeasured bird species‚Äô responses to infection using phylogenetic imputation, based on these species‚Äô phylogenetic relationships with bird species with measured responses.},

Our method allows these parameters to vary through time in a piecewise fashion and is implemented within the BEAST2 software framework. The method is a powerful alternative to the existing coalescent skyline plot, providing insight into the differing roles of incidence and prevalence in an epidemic. We apply this method to data from the United Kingdom HIV-1 epidemic and Egyptian hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemic. The analysis reveals temporal changes of the effective reproductive number that highlight the effect of past public health interventions.},
